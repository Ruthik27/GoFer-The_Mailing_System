In IGF processing, spectral tiles are copied from a spectral source location into a target location and subsequently adapted by parameter steered post-processing to best match relevant properties of the original signal. Important properties include the spectral and temporal envelope. Since IGF operates on Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) spectra of rather long time blocks, temporal envelope shaping is not trivial. In this paper, Temporal Tile Shaping (TTS) is presented.

While the latter features well-known perceptually adapted quantization of spectral coefficients, parametric techniques reconstruct the signal parts that have been quantized to zero by the encoder to meet the low-bitrate constraint. Large numbers of zeroed spectral values and especially consecutive zeros constituting gaps often lead to audible artifacts at the decoder. To avoid such artifacts the new 3GPP Enhanced Voice Services (EVS) coding standard utilizes noise filling and intelligent gap filling (IGF) techniques, guided by spectral envelope information. In this paper the underlying considerations of the parametric energy adjustment and transmission in EVS and its relation to noise filling, IGF, and tonality preservation are presented.

Watermark embedding has been done by weighted addition of the binary watermark in the singular values of the audio signal. DSR has been used in the extraction process to improve the authenticity of the extracted watermark by utilizing the noise or degradation introduced during different signal processing attacks. DSR is an iterative process that tunes the coefficient of possibly attacked watermarked audio signal so that effect of noise is suppressed and hidden information is enhanced. An adaptive optimization procedure has been adopted for selection of bistable parameters to achieve maximum correlation coefficient under minimum computational complexity. Resilience of this technique has been tested in presence of various signal processing attacks. Using proposed technique robust extraction of watermark is obtained without trading off the audibility of audio signal. Comparison with plain SVD-based, DWT-based and DCT-based techniques reflects that the proposed DSR-based audio watermarking scheme gives remarkably better performance in terms of correlation between original and extracted watermarks.","2076-1465","978-1-4673-1068-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6334139","Audio Watermarking;Singular Value Decomposition;Dynamic Stochastic Resonance;Noise","Watermarking;Robustness;Signal to noise ratio;Correlation;Speech;Stochastic resonance","audio watermarking;computational complexity;feature extraction;iterative methods;optimisation;singular value decomposition;stochastic processes","dynamic stochastic resonance-based watermark extraction;SVD domain;DSR-based watermark extraction technique;singular value decomposition;binary watermark;signal processing attacks;iterative process;watermarked audio signal;adaptive optimization procedure;maximum correlation coefficient;minimum computational complexity;DCT-based techniques;DWT-based techniques;DSR-based audio watermarking scheme","","","","12","","18 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In our method, LWT\DWT is first applied to decompose the host signal and obtain the corresponding approximate coefficients followed by DCT to take advantage of “energy compaction” property. SVD is further performed to acquire the singular values and enhance the robustness of the scheme. The adaptive DM quantization is adopted to quantize the singular values and embed the watermark. To withstand desynchronization attacks, synchronization code is inserted using audio statistical characteristics. Furthermore, the conflicting problem of robustness and imperceptibility is effectively resolved by the DE optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that both the LWT-DCT-SVD and DWT-DCT-SVD methods not only have good imperceptibility performance, but also resist general signal processing, hybrid and desynchronization attacks.

Two maps are firstly extracted from each audio file, i.e. scale-frequency map and damping-frequency map. The scale and frequency of the Gabor atoms are extracted to construct a scale-frequency map. On the other hand, the damping-frequency map is generated according to the frequency and damping factor of damped atoms. Gabor atoms can be utilized to model human auditory perception, and the damped atoms can be used to model commonly observed damped oscillations in natural signals. This work fuses the advantages of these two dictionaries to improve the performance of the system. During the recognition stage, this work constructs a kernel sparse representation-based classifier via the proposed kernel weighted Fisher sparse analysis to enhance separability. The proposed kernel weighted Fisher sparse analysis combines sparse representation with heteroscedastic kernel weighted discriminant analysis (HKWDA), which is useful for providing a discriminative recognition of audio events because a weighted pairwise Chernoff criterion is utilized in the kernel space. Experiments on a 20-class audio event database indicate that the proposed approach can achieve an accuracy rate of 82.70%. Also, integrating the scale-frequency map with MFCCs increases the accuracy rate to 87.70%.","2379-190X","978-1-5090-4117-6","10.1109/ICASSP.2017.7953310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7953310","Kernel weighted Fisher sparse analysis;scale-frequency map;damping-frequency map;kernel sparse classification;audio event classification","Kernel;Dictionaries;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Matching pursuit algorithms;Damping;Oscillators;Speech","audio signal processing;sparse matrices","Kernel weighted Fisher sparse analysis;audio event recognition;maps extraction;audio file;scale-frequency map;damping-frequency map;Gabor atoms;human auditory perception;recognition stage;kernel sparse representation-based classifier;kernel weighted Fisher sparse analysis;heteroscedastic kernel weighted discriminant analysis","","","","21","","19 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In audio steganography, encoding process is carried nut through inactive frames of low bit rate audio streams by performing iLBC (internet Low Bit rate Codec). This methodology can be used in applications such as VoIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol), streaming audio, archival and messaging. Traditionally, data embedding is carried out in the inactive frames rather than the active frame of streams; that is inactive frame has large embedding capacity. In addition VAD (Voice Activity Detection) algorithm is used for detecting inactive frames. The concealment of analysis is encoded by iLBC, that supports two basic frame lengths, giving a bit-rate of 13.3 kbps with an encoding frame length of 30 ms and 15.2 kbps with an encoding frame length of 20 nis .

A main criticism of the method, however, is that it ignores context. Each “word” is considered in isolation, ignoring its neighbors. We address this issue by representing the document by its audio word N-grams. Unlike words from natural language, audio words are generated by clustering algorithms where the number of clusters is specified by the researcher. We therefore also explore how the performance of the N-gram representation varies with codebook size. With this enhanced representation, we find the average probability of miss noticeably decreases when evaluated on TRECVID 2011 and 2012 datasets, indicating clear improvements on the multimedia event detection task.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-0356-6","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6637754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6637754","Bag-of-audio-words;N-gram models;multimedia event detection","Histograms;Vectors;Multimedia communication;Event detection;Videos;Natural languages;NIST","audio systems;codes;multimedia communication;pattern clustering;probability","bag-of-audio-word generation;multimedia event detection;document representation;audio word N-gram representation extension;natural language;clustering algorithm;codebook;average probability;TRECVID 2011 dataset;TRECVID 2012 dataset","","2","","11","","21 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, there have been many methods were proposed for detecting spoofing attacks in ASV, and significant progress has been made. However, current methods have shown little improvements in replay spoof attack detection as they lack a more suitable model for replay detection. To address this issue, in this article, we propose a novel model based on attention-enhanced DenseNet-BiLSTM network and segment-based linear filter bank features. First, silent segments are selected from each speech signal by using a short-term zero-crossing rate and energy. If the total duration of silent segments only contains a very limited amount of data, the decaying tails will be selected instead. Second, the linear filter bank features are extracted from the selected segments in the relatively high-frequency domain. Finally, an attention-enhanced DenseNet-BiLSTM architecture which can avoid the problems of overfitting is built. To validate this model, we used two datasets, including BTAS2016 and ASVspoof2017. Experiments show that using the attention-enhanced DenseNet-BiLSTM model with the segment-based linear filter bank feature achieves the best performance. Compared with the baseline system based on constant Q cepstral coefficient and Gaussian mixture model (GMM), the proposed model can produce a relative improvement of 91.68% and 74.04% on the two data sets respectively.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2020.2998870","Universidade de Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2018-00035-FST,MYRG2019-00086-FST); Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR(grant numbers:041/2017/A1,0019/2019/A); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9107432","Attack detection;attention-enhanced;denseNet-BiLSTM network;linear filter bank feature;replay spoof","Feature extraction;Speech processing;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Deep learning;Speech recognition;Task analysis;Filter banks","channel bank filters;feature extraction;neural nets;security of data;speaker recognition","Q cepstral coefficient;ASVspoof2017 datasets;BTAS2016 datasets;high-frequency domain;speech signal;audio replay spoof attack detection;joint segment-based linear filter bank feature extraction;Gaussian mixture model;attention-enhanced DenseNet-BiLSTM model;attention-enhanced DenseNet-BiLSTM architecture;short-term zero-crossing rate;attention-enhanced DenseNet-BiLSTM network;ASV systems;automatic speaker verification systems","","1","","59","IEEE","3 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We will show that the proposed invertible and low-complexity mapping of integers enables the GR encoding to assign nearly the optimal code length for a wider range of distributions, generalized Gaussian distributions, maintaining low computational cost. A simulation by random numbers reveals that the proposed coder based on this scheme works about 6 times faster than the state-of-the-art arithmetic coder for Gaussian-distributed integers maintaining the increase in relative redundancy around 2.6%, which is much lower than that of a conventional GR coder. Additionally, an application to a practical speech and audio coding scheme is presented, and an objective evaluation for real speech and audio signals confirms the advantages of the proposed method in compression.

But it has also put forth a new challenge to secure these multimedia data from privacy. In any kind of information system, data security and confidentiality services are generally required. In this paper we present a new secure audio watermarking technique based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) along with encryption. It combines Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and a blind audio watermarking technique based on FFT along with Fibonacci numbers. Combining the encryption and watermarking algorithm enhances the security of watermark. The performance of this scheme is calculated using signal to noise ratio and bit error rate. Results indicate that the method is not only secure but also robust against various signal processing attacks with high imperceptibility.","","978-1-5090-1285-5","10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7830133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7830133","Advanced Encryption Standard (AES);audio watermarking;Fast Fourier Transform;information security","Watermarking;Robustness;Encryption;Signal to noise ratio;Time-domain analysis;Frequency-domain analysis","audio watermarking;cryptography;fast Fourier transforms","secure audio watermarking;AES technique;advanced encryption standard;computer technology;data distribution;data security service;data confidentiality service;fast Fourier transform;FFT;blind audio watermarking technique;Fibonacci numbers;watermark security;signal-to-noise ratio;bit error rate;signal processing attacks","","1","","14","","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Identifying a reliable feature is a crucial step towards enhancing the front-end stage of both audio-module and visual-module. A two-dimensional Gabor filter with different scales and directions is utilized to generate a set of noise robust spectro-temporal audio and visual features. The performance achieved from the Gabor audio features (GAFs) and Gabor visual features (GVFs) is compared to the performance of the traditional audio features such as MFCC, PLP, RASTA-PLP and visual features such as DCT2. The experimental results demonstrate that a system utilizes Gabor features in the front-end has a much better performance, especially at low SNR levels. To enhance the back-end stage, a framework based on synchronous multi-stream hidden Markov model is proposed to solve the dynamic stream weight estimation problem. To demonstrate the effect of dynamic weighting on enhancing the AVSR performance, we empirically compare between late integration (LI) and early integration (EI) strategies, especially in a low-SNR scenario. The experimental results show that the AVSR-LI system achieves superior performance for all SNR levels compared to AVSR-EI system.","","978-1-5386-5111-7","10.1109/ICCES.2018.8639475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8639475","Audio-Visual Speech Recognition;Synchronous Multi-Stream Hidden Markov Model;Stream Weight","Visualization;Hidden Markov models;Signal to noise ratio;Speech recognition;Feature extraction;Adaptation models;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","audio signal processing;computer vision;feature extraction;Gabor filters;hidden Markov models;speech recognition","Gabor audio features;dynamic stream weight estimation problem;dynamic weighting;AVSR performance;AVSR-LI system;AVSR-EI system;robust audio-visual speech recognition system;dynamic stream weight adaption;visual-module;two-dimensional Gabor filter;Gabor features;synchronous multistream hidden Markov model;noise robust spectro-temporal visual features;Gabor visual features;late integration strategy;early integration strategy;audio-module","","","","11","","14 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional SVD-based blind audio watermarking algorithms lack physical interpretation since the matrix construction method for the input matrix for SVD is heuristically defined. However, in the proposed approach, because the SVD is directly applied to the stereo input signals, the resulting decomposed elements convey a conceptually meaningful inter- pretation of the original audio signal. As the proposed approach effectively utilizes the ratio of singular values, the embedded watermark is highly imperceptible and robust against volumetric scaling attacks; most QIM-based watermarking schemes are weak to these types of attacks. Experimental results under well-known practical attacks, such as compressions, resampling, and various types of signal processing, confirm that the proposed algorithm performs well compared to conventional audio watermarking algorithms.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2017.2721642","Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute; Korean Government(grant numbers:15ZR1200); The Development of Active Audioprint Technology to Enhance the Media Usage; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7962215","Audio watermarking;blind;data hiding;singular value decomposition (SVD);quantization index modulation (QIM);stereo","Watermarking;Robustness;Signal processing algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Quantization (signal);Frequency-domain analysis;Indexes","audio signal processing;audio watermarking;quantisation (signal);singular value decomposition","blind digital audio water-marking algorithm;SVD-based adaptive QIM watermarking;signal processing;QIM-based watermarking schemes;embedded watermark;stereo input signals;input matrix;matrix construction method;blind audio watermarking algorithms;singular value decomposition;quantization index modulation;stereo audio signals","","13","","38","Traditional","29 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study aims to utilize application software instead of hardware equipment to alter the sound of electric musical instruments by developing the functions of audio effect units on a mobile device. The built-in software audio effects include dynamic effects, delay effects, mixing, and equalization. Multichannel audio signal processing is proposed to enhance sound externalization. The listening tests indicate that the sound effects together with a quadraphonic system produce superior special effects and spatial audio than conventional effect units. Additionally, a denoiser is proposed for noise reduction, which is a function especially helpful for singers performing on busy streets. The customization in the module is achieved by a personal voice preprocessing system. A dual-filter function was utilized for the denoiser to adjust to different environments. The objective performance measurements demonstrate that the proposed denoiser outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. A hardware audio interface serving as the connection between a mobile device and an electric instrument, such as an electric guitar, electric piano, or electric bass, was also built, providing impedance matching and voltage balance. The proposed interface transfers the electric instrument signal into a 3.5-mm jack in a smartphone or tablet.

Hence these methods generally compute the channel response which is then utilized in designing the inverse filter. In this paper, a novel adaptive equalization method is developed where the channel impulse response and inverse filter are jointly estimated. The method iteratively estimates the uncertainties in the channel response using a Kalman filter and updates the inverse filter gains at every step. The joint estimation method is thus adaptive and robust to the highly varying in-car acoustic conditions. Additional contributions of this work include the development of a car database that captures impulse responses and noise samples under various in-car conditions. Both subjective and objective evaluations are performed to show the performance improvements obtained using the proposed method.","2379-190X","978-1-5386-4658-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462329","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8462329","adaptive equalization;car acoustics;inverse filtering;audio enhancement","Automobiles;Acoustics;Adaptive equalizers;Loudspeakers;Estimation;Channel estimation;Kalman filters","adaptive equalisers;audio equipment;audio systems;iterative methods;Kalman filters;transient response","channel impulse response;joint estimation method;in-car acoustic conditions;car database;impulse responses;in-car conditions;joint adaptive impulse response estimation;inverse filtering;in-car audio listening experience;in-car channel response;novel adaptive equalization method;Kalman Filter;audio equalization methods","","","","20","","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Validation of the system which consists of functionalities of LED TV set is in the focus. An audio verification method was also developed and this is currently being deployed at TPVision (Previously Philips TV) for test automation of audio verification in Interactive Multimedia LED TVs. The method is computationally efficient, scalable and capable of quickly performing audio compare on audio captured through a LED TV in the presence of foreground voices and other dominant noise. It can verify any format of audio, be it .mp3, .mp4, .wav, AC-3 or Dolby Digital sound signals, etc. This task is performed using MATLAB and later built into standalone application, which is successfully integrated into existing test automation environment. This work helps to reduce the time required in validation and also to enhance audio validation efficiency and reduce time for the same in test automation process to come up with better working product.","","978-1-4673-6217-7","10.1109/ICACCI.2013.6637443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6637443","Automated validations;Functional verification;Image comparison;Audio compare;Test automation;LED TV;Audio verification","Automation;TV;Testing;Light emitting diodes;Software;Manuals;Hardware","audio signal processing;automatic testing;interactive television;LED displays;multimedia systems","system validation effectiveness enhancement;system validation time reduction;interactive multimedia LED TV;automatic functionality validation;audio verification method;TPVision;Philips TV;foreground voices;.mp3 audio format;.mp4 audio format;.wav audio format;AC-3 audio format;Dolby Digital sound signals;Matlab;standalone application;test automation environment;audio validation efficiency enhancement","","1","","30","","21 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Hierarchical Model For Long-Length Video Summarization With Adversarially Enhanced Audio/Visual Features","H. Lee; G. Lee","Seoul National University of Science and Technology,Republic of Korea; Seoul National University of Science and Technology,Republic of Korea","2020 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)","30 Sep 2020","2020","","","723","727","In this paper, we propose a novel supervised method for summarizing long-length videos. Many recent approaches presented promising results in video summarization. However, videos in most benchmark datasets are short in duration (<; 10 minutes), and the methods often do not work well for very long-length videos (>1 hour). Furthermore, most approaches only use visual features, while audios provide useful information for the task. Based on these observations, we present a model that exploits both audio and visual features. To handle long videos, the hierarchical structure of our model captures both the short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. Our model also refines the extracted features using adversarial networks. To demonstrate our model, we have collected a new dataset of 28 baseball (~3.5 hours) videos, accompanied by an editorial summary video that is 5% in length of the original video. Evaluation on the dataset suggests that our method produces quality summaries for very long videos.","2381-8549","978-1-7281-6395-6","10.1109/ICIP40778.2020.9190636","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9190636","video summarization;multimodal features;hierarchical model;adversarial learning;long-length videos","Visualization;Feature extraction;Semantics;Benchmark testing;Task analysis;Generators","audio-visual systems;feature extraction;neural nets;sport;video signal processing","hierarchical model;long-length video summarization;novel supervised method;benchmark datasets;hierarchical structure;long-term temporal dependencies;baseball videos;editorial summary video;adversarially enhanced audio-visual features;short-term temporal dependencies;adversarial networks;feature extraction;time 10.0 min;time 1.0 hour;time 3.5 hour","","","","15","","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
