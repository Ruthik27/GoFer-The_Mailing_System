Group key agreement (GKA) protocols enable a group of members to negotiate a common encryption key via open networks so that only the group members can decrypt the ciphertexts encrypted under the shared encryption key, but a sender cannot exclude any particular member from decrypting the ciphertexts. In this paper, we bridge these two notions with a hybrid primitive referred to as contributory broadcast encryption (ConBE). In this new primitive, a group of members negotiate a common public encryption key while each member holds a decryption key. A sender seeing the public group encryption key can limit the decryption to a subset of members of his choice. Following this model, we propose a ConBE scheme with short ciphertexts. The scheme is proven to be fully collusion-resistant under the decision n-Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponentiation (BDHE) assumption in the standard model. Of independent interest, we present a new BE scheme that is aggregatable. The aggregatability property is shown to be useful to construct advanced protocols.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2015.2419662","Chinese National Key Basic Research Program(grant numbers:2012CB315905); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61370190,61173154,61472429,61402029,61272501,61202465,61321064,61003214); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4132056); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:14XNLF02); Renmin University of China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Trusted Computing; DwB; Inter-Trust; CLARUS; Spanish Government(grant numbers:TSI-020302-2010-153,TIN2011-27076-C03-01); Catalan Government(grant numbers:2014 SGR 537); Templeton World Charity Foundation(grant numbers:TWCF0095); NSF(grant numbers:12ZR1443500); Shanghai Chen Guang Program(grant numbers:12CG24); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:13JC1403500); ICREA-Acadèmia; Catalan Government; Google Faculty Research Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7079389","Broadcast encryption;group key agreement;contributory broadcast encryption;provable security;Broadcast encryption;group key agreement;contributory broadcast encryption;provable security","Encryption;Protocols;Public key;Receivers;Games","cryptographic protocols;public key cryptography","ciphertexts;trusted party;decryption key distribution;group key agreement protocols;GKA protocols;contributory broadcast encryption schemes;ConBE scheme;public group encryption key;collusion-resistant scheme;n-bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponentiation assumption;BDHE assumption","","20","","51","","3 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many types of encryption algorithms were applied in the cloud for securing the data. Data can be stored in the cloud in an encrypted form. So, a new technique called Homomorphic encryption is introduced that allows to apply specific operations on the encrypted data. The paper presents an overview of security issues in cloud computing and utilization of the fully homomorphic encryption technique has drawbacks of large key size and low calculation efficiency, and it is not practical for the secure cloud computing. We build up a hybrid homomorphic encryption scheme based on the GM encryption algorithm which is additively (single bit) homomorphic, and RSA algorithm which is multiplicative homomorphic. The hybridization of homomorphic encryption schemes seems to be an effective way to defeat their limitations and to benefit from their resistance against the confidentiality attacks. This hybridization of homomorphic encryption algorithm lead to increase the speed (2.9) times, reduce the computation time to 66% percentage from previous one, enhanced confidentiality of the data that is stored in the cloud by enhancing security (two layer of encryption methods used) . Since hybrid encryption is utilized high security and authentication is provided.","","978-1-5386-9188-5","10.1109/AiCIS.2018.00043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8640952","homomorphic-encryption;-partially-homomorphic-encryption;-hybrid-homomorphic-encryption;-RSA,-Goldwasser-Micali-GM.","Encryption;Cloud computing;Ciphers;Public key;Additives","cloud computing;cryptography","security concerns;encryption algorithms;encrypted form;encrypted data;security issues;fully homomorphic encryption technique;secure cloud computing;hybrid homomorphic encryption scheme;GM encryption algorithm;encryption methods;hybrid encryption;multistage partial homomorphic encryption","","4","","12","","14 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data owner uploads their private information to the cloud server and relies on the services that the cloud provides to execute some operations on data. When data is stored in the cloud, performing data retrieval while preserving confidentiality of data is a big challenge. In order to protect data confidentiality and security, the sensitive data need to be encrypted before outsourcing to the cloud. However, with the increasing number of encrypted data stored in the cloud, how to retrieve required information efficiently from the mass encrypted data is still a challenge urgently to be addressed. In this paper, a new ciphertext retrieval method is proposed to solve the above problem. In this method, the database is divided into several block encryption, and each block encryption is assigned to an index file correspondingly. The index files are encrypted with onion encryption, which allows the server to execute the queries while protecting data confidentiality. The experiment indicates that this encryption scheme can improve the efficiency of encrypted database retrieve.","","978-1-4673-8537-4","10.1109/CBD.2015.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7435480","cloud storage;index encryption;onions of encryption;data retrieval","Encryption;Indexes;Cloud computing;Servers;Public key","cloud computing;cryptography;data protection;information retrieval;outsourcing;storage management","block-based encryption method;data outsourcing;cloud computing;data service;data owner;cloud server;data retrieval;data confidentiality protection;data security;mass encrypted data;ciphertext retrieval method;onion encryption","","","","21","","21 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A set of attributes becomes an identifier for the user or owner to access data. It also successfully assimilates encryption and access control for sharing secret data among groups. Non-efficiency and non-existence of the attribute revocation mechanism is the open problem in an Attribute-Based Encryption Scheme. The two classes of Attribute based Encryption mechanism, such as CP-ABE (Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based Encryption) and KP-ABE (Key Policy Attribute-based Encryption) concepts are utilized to solve various data sharing security issues in a cloud environment.

Data deduplication allows cloud storage providers (CSP) to save storage space by eliminating the copies of the same data. Data encryption can ensure the confidentiality of customer's data both in transit and at rest. However, deduplication that works on detecting identical data does not work well with encrypted data provided by conventional encryption. Encryption of the same data using different key (by different subscribers) will result in different ciphertexts that will not allow the CSP to carry out deduplication. In this paper, we propose a scheme to allow deduplication on encrypted data with the aid of a key server deployed at cloud service provider premises, called HEDup (Homomorphic Encryption Deduplication). In this solution, the subscriber encrypts data with data-encryption key obtained from key server via various key-management schemes, one of which uses homomorphic encryption. The main contributions of this project are (1) with a key server deployed at cloud provider premises, it will not only deduplicate data from particular domain but also for the CSP's entire client base including public and different enterprise users - this results in higher storage savings and (2) data owners still maintain exclusive control of their data and data-encryption keys, i.e. CSP has no access to any of it - strong confidentiality guarantees. The experiments conducted show that data uploads and downloads using HEDup have minor storage and latency overhead. Our implementation also shows significant performance optimization when compared to commercial key management service for cloud object storage.","","978-1-4673-7891-8","10.1109/NAS.2015.7255226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7255226","Data Deduplication;Homomorphic Encryption;Confidentiality;Cloud Storage;Key Server","Encryption;Servers;Cloud computing;Databases;Data privacy","cloud computing;private key cryptography;public key cryptography;storage management","HEDup;secure data deduplication;cloud storage providers;cloud subscribers;CSP;storage space;data encryption;customer data confidentiality;identical data detection;ciphertexts;homomorphic encryption deduplication;enterprise users;data owners;data-encryption keys;latency overhead;commercial key management service;cloud object storage","","4","","17","","14 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The data sharing protocol uses identity-based proxy re-encryption technology and distributed key generation technology.

Here we are adding the pseudorandom values to the corresponding pixels of the image and we are using the reverse operation to decrypt it. Data hiding is the process to hide the extra data which we are incorporating in the encrypted version of image to provide high security. Data hiding in lossless method, we propose a wet paper coding method. By this method we can split the image into different layers and we can add or embedded some data to certain layers only. The layers which we are using for data incorporation is nothing but dry and which we are not using is wet. With this we will recover that image perfectly but when we need to transmit with reversible process at the receiver side we will get the error. To obtain the perfect image along with the data we are combining the lossless and reversible methods with this we will get high psnr, But to improve the security we will multiply the key with some value and the technique what we are embedding is watermarking. The watermarking involves embedding operation first and after that we will apply encryption to the input image. Efficient data hiding means we need to get the original image at the receiver side must be equal to transmitter side so decryption and watermarking is applied again to get the original image with less loss of data or image and high security. For this we are using multiplicative encryption method to increase the efficiency. The data and the image can be perfectly recovered without any loss with this method.","","978-1-5090-5013-0","10.1109/CESYS.2017.8321155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8321155","Datahiding;Encryption;combined scheme of reversible and lossless;Multiplicative encryption;Watermarking PSNR","Encryption;Data mining;Watermarking;Histograms;Conferences","cryptography;data encapsulation;image coding","multiplicative symmetric key generation based encryption;cipher text;cipher image;wet paper coding method;data hiding;multiplicative encryption","","","","12","","22 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Attribute-based encryption can be used to ensure data security while providing fine-grained data access. However, current attribute-based encryption schemes rarely consider the access control of time, and the integrity verification of data simultaneously. In response to the above two problems, we propose a time and attribute based dual access control and data integrity verifiable scheme in cloud computing applications (DCDV). Firstly, a hierarchical time tree is introduced in the attribute-based encryption technology by using of hierarchical identity-based encryption technology to set an effective access time period and a specified decryptable time period for the user's attributes key and encrypted data separately. The decryption operation can only be performed if the attribute set of user satisfies the data owner's access policy and the effective access time period of the user's attributes key completely covered the decryption time period set by the data owner. In this way, the data is dual controlled with time and attributes to solve the problem of privacy data leakage caused by private key leakage. Secondly, by using of the inverted index and Merkle hash tree, the data verification tree is designed. The data user can verify the integrity of the ciphertext data returned by the cloud server without decryption, which solves the problem that the cloud server may delete or modify the data. Finally, the security proof and efficiency analysis show that our scheme is secure and practical.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2942649","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572019); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2016JZ001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8845646","Attribute based encryption;dual access control;time specified encryption;data integrity verification","Cloud computing;Encryption;Access control;Data integrity;Servers;Identity-based encryption","authorisation;cloud computing;data integrity;data privacy;private key cryptography","cloud computing applications;Big Data;cloud-based industrial applications;resource-constrained smart devices;data security;fine-grained data access;attribute-based encryption schemes;integrity verification;dual access control;data integrity verifiable scheme;hierarchical time tree;attribute-based encryption technology;hierarchical identity-based encryption technology;specified decryptable time period;encrypted data;data owner;decryption time period;privacy data leakage;data verification tree;data user;ciphertext data;cloud server;access time period","","4","","43","CCBY","20 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to Gentry's scheme, fully homomorphic scheme over the integers can make complicated matters simplified but have not been widely applied due to the low efficiency. In this paper, a new improved FHE scheme based on DGHV scheme is proposed. We reduce the public key size significantly by introducing a pseudo-random number generator and encrypting with a cubic form rather than a linear form in the public key elements, which makes our scheme more efficient.

To address the challenges of data security, cryptography is used for storage as well as for the communication of data. A cryptographic algorithm has two main performance characteristics: the ability to secure data against different attacks and the processing speed. An algorithm is considered secure if no attack exists to reveal the original contents without knowing the key. The strength of any secure encryption algorithm is, therefore, generally measured based on the difficulty to obtain the encryption key through cyber-attacks such as brute force. It is presumed that the bigger the key size, the more difficult it is for the attacker to compute the key. Consequently, increasing the key size generally increases the computational complexity and processing time of algorithms. As a result, an established assumption is the existence of a tradeoff and computational complexity. In this paper, we are presenting an alternate symmetric key encryption algorithm, which can easily avoid long and complex computation of conventional popular symmetric key encryption algorithms such as the Data Encryption Standards and the Advance Encryption Standard. We have shown that despite providing a higher level of security, one simplest software implementation of our algorithm is faster than some previously implemented conventional algorithms. Additionally, our algorithm also provides other advantages such as inherent data compression option and flexibility of choosing different complexity levels according to the need for different applications.","","978-1-5386-9509-8","10.1109/ICOMET.2019.8673469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8673469","Encryption Algorithm;Symmetric Key;Data Encryption Standard;Advanced Encryption Standard;Cryptography;Security;Data Compression","Encryption;Receivers;Channel coding;Standards","computational complexity;cryptography;data compression","information technology;information security;data security;cryptographic algorithm;secure encryption algorithm;encryption key;cyber-attacks;computational complexity;inherent data compression option;symmetric key encryption algorithm;data encryption standards;advance encryption standard","","3","","21","","25 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such data however, are required to be processed in terms of search queries, aggregation, clustering or classification. For better data analysis, the stored data on the server and a result of the processed data should be in lexicographic order. The conventional recourse such as offloading-decryption-ordering, may not be an efficient mechanism for huge data collection since it involves large communication overhead and breach of data privacy. Functional Encryption (FE) provides a viable solution as it offers encrypted data processing at the remote server site while preserving the privacy of the processed data. In this paper, we propose an improvised functional encryption for encrypted data ordering that takes as input multiple ciphertexts and orders them at the server site, without compromising data privacy. As ordering involves at least two data, we formalize an order function using multi-input functional encryption with obfuscation. The proposed approach, Multi-Input Functional Encryption for Ordering (MIFEO) runs an order function on multiple ciphertexts at the server site, arranges them in order and generates an ordered set of ciphertexts. Using online E-health system as a case study, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed MIFEO scheme in a practical scenario.","","978-1-5386-3039-6","10.1109/RAIT.2018.8389084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8389084","Functional Encryption;Indistinguishability based security;Function Obfuscation;Multi-Input Functional Encryption;Data Ordering","Servers;Encryption;Data privacy;Data analysis;Iron","cloud computing;cryptography;data analysis;data privacy;storage management","encrypted data ordering;cloud storage server;data analysis;lexicographic order;offloading-decryption-ordering;data processing;multiinput functional encryption;data privacy","","","","28","","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also it is necessary to provide a query processing scheme without decrypting the encrypted data. For this, we propose a group order preserving data encryption scheme based on periodic functions (GOPES). Our GOPES generates encryption signatures based on data groups and periodic functions. With this, we can can guarantee the data privacy.","","978-1-4799-8937-9","10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336287","order-preserving encryption scheme;data privacy protection;group order-preserving;encrypted query processing;database outsourcing","Encryption;Conferences;Query processing;Data privacy","cryptography;query processing","group order-preserving encryption scheme;periodic functions;query processing;encrypted data;outsourced database;GOPES;encryption signatures;data privacy","","","","5","","30 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
