Security analysis and enhanced design of a dynamic block cipher was proposed. Firstly, the safety of ciphertext was enhanced based on confusion substitution of S-box, thus disordering the internal structure of data blocks by four steps of matrix transformation. Then, the diffusivity of cipher-text was obtained by cyclic displacement of bytes using column ambiguity function. The dynamic key was finally generated by using LFSR, which improved the stochastic characters of secret key in each of round of iteration. The safety performance of proposed algorithm was analyzed by simulation test. The results showed the proposed algorithm has a little effect on the speed of encryption and decryption while enhancing the security. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm has highly scalability, the dimension of S-box and the number of register can be dynamically extended according to the security requirement.","1673-5447","","10.1109/CC.2016.7405712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7405712","cryptography;block cipher;encryption algorithm;safety analysis","Heuristic algorithms;Encryption;Transforms;Ciphers;Safety","cryptography;iterative methods","security analysis;dynamic block cipher design;security issues;block cipher algorithm;ciphertext safety;confusion substitution;internal structure;data blocks;cyclic displacement;column ambiguity function;LFSR;stochastic characters;simulation test;encryption;decryption","","1","","","","12 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The technique of securing data is also known as cryptography. In this research, it has been done to improve data security by combining the Hill Cipher Algorithm with the Caesar Cipher Algorithm. This process can be seen from the tests that have been carried out in this study. The result is in a different and sufficiently improved processing time both in terms of decryption and encryption. By combining the two cryptographic algorithms, it is known that message security is much better. It occurs because the encryption and decryption process of the message is carried out using 2 different keys. Based on the tests, it shows that the time of the encryption process with the decryption process on the <tex>$5\times 5$</tex> matrix key is very different from using the <tex>$3\times 3$</tex> matrix key, the difference is slightly different in time. It shows that the use of a larger matrix key affects the decryption process is very long and also influenced by other cryptographic algorithm processes.

It is used by many large agencies, and popular for its computational efficiency in both software and hardware. However, the standard (Rijndael) S-box used of AES is a static and fixed matrix. Thus, a backdoor can be built into the cipher to exploit this feature. In this paper, we argue for a very simple key dependent S-box scheme which generates a dynamic S-box for each round of encryption. Our scheme uses some bits of the primary key (or expanded key) to directly manipulate the standard S-box in such a way that its content is changed but its cryptographic properties are preserved. We show using experimental tests that our proposed scheme strengthens the cipher against certain attacks, at the expense of a relatively modest one-time computational procedure during the set-up phase.","","978-1-7281-3873-2","10.1109/ICSPIS48135.2019.9045900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9045900","Block cipher;AES;S-Box","Ciphers;Standards;Encryption;Conferences;Signal processing","cryptography","key-dependent S-box scheme;block ciphers;advanced encryption standard;AES;computational efficiency;de facto standard block cipher;security enhancement;Rijndael;dynamic S-box scheme;standard S-box scheme","","1","","12","","26 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides shedding light on the coverage achieved by the proposed recommendations, we discuss implications towards aspects of test quality. One of them relates to the testing of a TLS implementation, where a system designer or tester should expand the TLS cipher suite registry and integrate the information back to the TLS implementation itself such that the (overall) testing effort is reduced.","","978-1-5090-4127-5","10.1109/QRS.2016.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7589786","Combinatorial testing;coverage;measurement;TLS;subsets;cipher suites","Ciphers;Protocols;Encryption;Testing;Software","combinatorial mathematics;cryptography;program testing","combinatorial coverage measurement;intelligence organizations;test quality;TLS cipher suite registry;TLS cipher suite recommendations;TLS implementation;regulatory organizations","","3","","11","","13 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Related-cipher attack was introduced by Hongjun Wu in 2002 and applied to block ciphers. The related ciphers can be considered as ciphers with the same round function, but with different round numbers. There has not been any related-cipher attack applied to Salsa20 stream cipher. In this paper, we apply related-cipher attack on stream cipher Salsa20, since Salsa20 uses flexible rounds (reduced-round versions of Salsa20) and the key schedule of Salsa20 is independent of the number of rounds. If a secret key is used in Salsa20/12 and Salsa20/8 to encrypt the same message, we can recover the 256-bit secret key with computational complexity of about 2<sup>224</sup>. The result shows that related-cipher attack may be also applied to stream ciphers.","","978-1-4673-2406-9","10.1109/ICCIS.2012.217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6301326","Related-Cipher Attack;Salsa20;Stream Cipher;Truncated Differential Cryptanalysis","Encryption;Computational complexity;Software;Schedules","computational complexity;cryptography","eSTREAM project;related-cipher attack;block cipher;round function;round number;Salsa20 stream cipher;flexible rounds;reduced-round version;secret key;Salsa20/12;Salsa20/8;encryption;computational complexity;word length 256 bit","","2","","19","","13 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These channels will be where the cipher text will be put in to create an image.

This method is used for transferring secured data in various fields like medical, research, hospitals, industrial sites, military applications etc. A Cryptographic attack exists, when the security of cryptosystem gets collapsed. In order to protect the cryptosystem from attack, an attack tolerant method is required. In this paper we have proposed a method to have attack tolerant algorithm by error detection and correction method. The attack tolerant method uses modified RC4 Stream Cipher. The modified RC4 Stream Cipher generates secret keys for encryption with the plain text to form Cipher text. Also, we use modified Matrix code algorithm for error correction in the secret keys generated by the modified RC4 Stream Cipher algorithm. The modified Matrix code algorithm can correct multiple errors in the secret keys generated. Thus the designed attack tolerant algorithm provides robustness to the corruption of secret data in communication standard and protocols.","","978-1-5090-0396-9","10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7754146","RC4 Stream Cipher;Matrix Code;tolerance-free attack algorithm","Algorithm design and analysis;Ciphers;Error correction codes;Scheduling algorithms;Signal processing algorithms","cryptography;error correction codes;error detection codes;fault diagnosis;telecommunication security","modified matrix code algorithm;cipher text encryption;plain text encryption;secret keys;error detection method;attack tolerant method;cryptosystem security;cryptographic attack;RC4 stream cipher algorithm;error correction scheme;fault detection","","1","","12","","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
