The suggested architecture is capable of handling all possible combinations of standard bit lengths (128,192,256) of data and key. The fully rolled inner- pipelined architecture ensures lesser hardware complexity. The architecture does reutilize precomputed blocks, in the sense that the same hardware is shared during encryption and decryption as much as possible. The design has been implemented on Xilinx XCVe1000-8bg560 device. The performance of the architecture has been compared with existing results in the literature and has been found to be the most efficient (throughput/area) implementation of the AES algorithm.","2380-6923","0-7695-3083-4","10.1109/VLSI.2008.82","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4450578","","Cryptography;Hardware;Computer architecture;Clocks;Very large scale integration;Design optimization;Delay;Field programmable gate arrays;Application specific integrated circuits;Arithmetic","cryptography;hardware-software codesign;pipeline processing","single chip encryptor/decryptor core;AES algorithm;advanced encryption standard;pipelined architecture;lesser hardware complexity;precomputed blocks","","2","","21","","12 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology","6 Aug 2002","1989","","","203","210","The concept of collision free hash functions has been shown to be a useful building block of signature schemes and message authentication schemes. In this paper, a fast and secure proposal is made for a 2n-bit collison free hash function based on an n-bit encryp tion algorithm. In case of the DES, the length of the result is 128 bits, which suffices to thwart a birthday attack.","","","10.1109/CCST.1989.751980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=751980","","Proposals;Protection;Security;Public key cryptography;Laboratories;Message authentication;Cryptographic protocols;Digital signatures;Public key;Pressing","","","","18","","42","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"SE-PPFM: A Searchable Encryption Scheme Supporting Privacy-Preserving Fuzzy Multikeyword in Cloud Systems","M. Zhang; Y. Chen; J. Huang","School of Computer Science and Information Security, Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China; School of Computers, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, China; School of Computers, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, China","IEEE Systems Journal","7 Jun 2021","2021","15","2","2980","2988","Cloud computing provides an appearing application for compelling vision in managing big-data files and responding queries over a distributed cloud platform. To overcome privacy revealing risks, sensitive documents and private data are usually stored in the clouds in a cipher-based manner. However, it is inefficient to search the data in traditional encryption systems. Searchable encryption is a useful cryptographic primitive to enable users to retrieve data in ciphertexts. However, the traditional searchable encryptions provide lower search efficiency and cannot carry out fuzzy multikeyword queries. To solve this issue, in this article, we propose a searchable encryption that supports privacy-preserving fuzzy multikeyword search (SE-PPFM) in cloud systems, which is built by asymmetric scalar-product-preserving encryptions and Hadamard product operations. In order to realize the functionality of efficient fuzzy searches, we employ Word2vec as the primitive of machine learning to obtain a fuzzy correlation score between encrypted data and queries predicates. We analyze and evaluate the performance in terms of token of multikeyword, retrieval and match time, file retrieval time and matching accuracy, etc. The experimental results show that our scheme can achieve a higher efficiency in fuzzy multikeyword ciphertext search and provide a higher accuracy in retrieving and matching procedure.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2020.2997932","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672010); State Key Laboratory of Cryptology of China; Key Projects of Guangxi Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019JJD170020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9115015","Asymmetric scalar-product-preserving encryp-tion (ASPE);fuzzy search;multikeyword;privacy protection;searchable encryption","Encryption;Cloud computing;Indexes;Correlation;Servers","","","","2","","32","IEEE","11 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
