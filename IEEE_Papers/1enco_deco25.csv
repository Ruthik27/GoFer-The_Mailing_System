"Encoding and Decoding Schemes in Communication Systems using Orthogonal Coding for Noise Immunity’s Increase","A. V.

It is shown, that the orthogonal coding allows to provide the required quality of communication with a smaller energy cost. The energy gain in signal-to-noise ratio is provided by more effective use of energy of transmitted signals with the fixed code rate, without increase in complexity and cost of transmitting/receiving schemes. The orthogonal coding is an analogue of convolutional coding over the rational numbers' field. Properties of orthogonality of proposed codes allow to strengthen significance of useful signal with simultaneous weakening of influence of AWGN. Technical realization of orthogonal coding is characterized by low complexity: on each step a decoding process is reduced to calculation of several dot products and comparison with the fixed (zero, in this case) threshold. For this reason, the offered way of coding and design of receiving and transmitting schemes can be implemented in various communication systems.","","978-1-7281-2288-5","10.1109/WECONF.2019.8840610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8840610","noiseless coding;orthogonal coding;phase-shift keying;spectral efficiency;encoding schemes;decoding schemes.","Encoding;Decoding;Convolutional codes;Bit error rate;Communication systems;Delays;Signal to noise ratio","AWGN channels;channel coding;convolutional codes;decoding;orthogonal codes;phase shift keying","noise immunity;information communication systems;signal-to-noise ratio;fixed code rate;convolutional coding;orthogonal coding;energy cost;encoding schemes;decoding schemes;transmitting-receiving schemes;AWGN;phase shift keying","","3","","11","","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An intermittent update principle is adopted in both the encoding-decoding mechanism and the learning control algorithm to handle the effects of data dropouts. A special case, in which no consecutive dropouts exist along the iteration axis, is provided first and then extended to a general case, in which bounded consecutive data dropouts are allowed.

Successive cancellation decoding (SCD) and belief propagation decoding (BPD) are two common approaches for decoding polar codes. SCD is sequential in nature while BPD can run in parallel. Thus BPD is more attractive for low latency applications. However BPD has some performance degradation at higher SNR when compared with SCD. Concatenating LDPC with Polar codes is one popular approach to enhance the performance of BPD, where a short LDPC code is used as an outer code and Polar code is used as an inner code. In this work we propose a new way to construct concatenated LDPC-Polar code, which not only outperforms conventional BPD and existing concatenated LDPC-Polar code but also shows a performance improvement of 0.5 dB at higher SNR regime when compared with SCD.","2379-447X","978-1-4673-6853-7","10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8050835","Polar Codes;Belief Propagation Decoding (BPD);Low-Density Parity Check Codes (LDPC codes);successive cancellation decoding (SCD);Concatenated codes","Parity check codes;Decoding;Complexity theory;Belief propagation;Encoding;Signal to noise ratio;Reliability","belief networks;concatenated codes;decoding;encoding;parity check codes","concatenated LDPC-polar codes decoding;encoding complexity;successive cancellation decoding;SCD;belief propagation decoding;BPD;performance degradation;outer code;inner code","","5","","14","","28 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the intentional inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by OvTDM will make the decoding process more complex. The computational complexity of maximum likelihood sequence detection increases exponentially with the growth of spectral efficiency in OvTDM. As a consequence of high complexity, the decoding effort for a given spectral efficiency may occasionally exceed the physical limitations of the decoder, leading inevitably to buffer overflows and information erasures. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional Viterbi algorithm (BVA) based on the bidirectional sequence decoding for OvTDM. With the BVA, the decoding operation starts simultaneously from the both ends of the corresponding trellis and stops at the middle of trellis. The simulation results show that compared with Viterbi algorithm (VA), the decoding time of BVA can be reduced by about half. And the memory space of two decoders in BVA are about half of that in VA, which means that the BVA has lower memory requirements for decoder. And the decoding performance of BVA is almost the same as VA.","1673-5447","","10.23919/J.CC.2020.07.013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9147142","overlapped time domain multiplexing (OvTDM);Viterbi algorithm (VA);bidirectional Viterbi algorithm (BVA);decoding performance","Maximum likelihood decoding;Spectral efficiency;Viterbi algorithm;Convolutional codes;Encoding;Multiplexing","computational complexity;encoding;maximum likelihood detection;time division multiplexing;trellis codes;Viterbi decoding","OvTDM;BVA;bidirectional sequence;bidirectional Viterbi decoding algorithm;overlapped time domain multiplexing;innovative encoding scheme;spectral efficiency;intentional inter-symbol interference;decoding process;computational complexity;maximum likelihood sequence detection","","","","","","24 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

A large-scale neuronal network model of the rat entorhinal-dentate system was developed with multicompartmental representations of the neurons within the dentate gyrus. Spatial information was introduced to the network via grid cell activity, and the spatial information encoding capabilities of the network were assessed using a recursive decoding algorithm to estimate the position of a virtual rat using the dentate activity. To obtain a measure for the information that the network could convey, decoding error was calculated for different decoding population sizes. Decoding error decreased exponentially as a function of population size. Therefore, the time constant and the asymptote of the error curve could be used as metrics to compare the changes in encoding performance.

It is meaningful to implement computations by making use of the response of population of neurons to determine a certain stimulus or to obtain the values of related parameters. Neural populations cannot only encode a single attribute of a stimulus but also can encode various properties of a stimulus simultaneously. For example, by looking at a moving object we can estimate the direction and speed of it, which shows that the response of a population of optic neurons contain information about both the direction and speed. In this paper we present a simple model for reading neural population signals for the two attributes of a stimulus. We use Poisson distribution to describe the encoding process of neural populations and then to extract the values of the stimulus by Bayesian methods. We demonstrate that the nervous population can encode two properties of a stimulus and extract the two kinds of estimated values of the stimulus at the same time.

Therefore, most of decoding termination occurs due to lack of ripple at early stage. In this study, we aim at reducing early decoding termination for low symbol loss probability. First, given k input symbols, the degree-1 proportion is increased to enlarge the average ripple size within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ k=2, where n is the number of decoded input symbols. Second, we propose Non-Repetitive (NR) encoding scheme to avoid generating repeated degree-1 encoding symbols. An NR encoder forces the first k degree-1 encoding symbols to connect to different input symbols. Simulation results show that NR encoding outperforms LT encoding in terms of symbol loss probability. Besides, less encoding symbols is needed to achieve high successful decoding probability when our scheme is applied. With k = 2000, NR encoding reaches a successful decoding probability of 99.6% when overhead is 0.2, while LT encoding requires an overhead of 0.32 to reach the same probability.","","978-1-4577-1729-1","10.1109/APCCAS.2012.6419120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6419120","LT code;degree;BP decoding;Non-Repetitive encoding","Encoding;Decoding;Robustness;Solitons;Upper bound;Receivers;Simulation","decoding;probability;transform coding","nonrepetitive encoding;robust soliton distribution;ripple size;BP decoding process;decoding termination;low symbol loss probability;degree-1 proportion;decoded input symbol;NR encoding;repeated degree-1 encoding symbol;LT encoding;decoding probability","","1","","8","","24 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At high areal densities in magnetic recording system major cause of small bit and track width as a way to overcome 2D interference, which consisting of inter-symbol interference (ISI) and intertrack interference (ITI). One way to improve performance of this problem, we need to be handled by using 2D modulation code with a simulation model in a bit-patterned media recording (BPMR). The previous research of modulation codes such as constructive ITI (CITI) code was created based on the hard decision. In this work; however, we propose a soft decision output decoding algorithm of a rate-5/6 constructive ITI (CITI) code to utilize it in an iterative decoding process. The proposed use the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) algebra in Boolean logic mappings with a modified 2D soft-output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) detector. When we consider the BER=10<sup>6</sup>, simulation results show that the proposed encoding and decoding schemes offer approximately 1.5 and 3 dB gains over the conventional coded system at 2 and 3 Tera-bit per square inch (Tb/in<sup>2</sup>), respectively. In addition, the gains of approximately 0.2 and 1.5 dBs are obtained over that of a hard decision decoding of modulation code regarding with the same code rate and the same areal density, respectively.","","978-1-7281-3271-6","10.1109/ITC-CSCC.2019.8793326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8793326","Bit-Patterned Media Recording;2D interference;2D Modulation Code;log-likelihood ratio;Boolean logic circuit","Two dimensional displays;Encoding;Decoding;Modulation;Interference;Iterative decoding;Media","Boolean algebra;error statistics;intersymbol interference;iterative decoding;magnetic recording;modulation coding;Viterbi decoding","bit-patterned magnetic recording systems;BPMR;recording storage;high areal densities;track width;intertrack interference;simulation model;iterative decoding process;log-likelihood ratio algebra;modified 2D soft-output Viterbi algorithm detector;hard decision decoding;code rate;areal density;BPMR systems;2D modulation code;bit-patterned media recording;soft decision output encoding-decoding algorithms;rate-5/6 CITI code;intersymbol interference;ISI;performance improvement;rate-5/6 constructive ITI code;LLR algebra;Boolean logic mappings;modified 2D SOVA detector","","","","6","","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The encoding of a cyclic code of a prime length is performed on a collection of codewords which are mapped through Galois Fourier transform into a codeword in a low-density parity-check code with a binary parity-check matrix for transmission. Using this matrix, binary iterative soft-decision decoding algorithm is applied to jointly decode a collection of codewords from the cyclic code. The joint-decoding allows for information sharing among the received vectors corresponding to the codewords in the collection during the iterative decoding process. For decoding Reed-Solomon and BCH codes of prime lengths, the proposed decoding scheme not only requires much lower decoding complexity than other soft-decision decoding algorithms for these codes, but also yields superior performance. The proposed decoding scheme can also achieve a joint-decoding gain over the maximum likelihood decoding of individual codewords.

Though GRS codes provide enormous flexibility, they are computationally expensive since calculations happen in Galois fields. In this paper, we present an algorithm to reduce the number of field multiplications in the encoding process of the GRS codes by selecting good values of α and ω, the parameters of a GRS code. These values are usually set to some default value but by finding good values for these parameters using our algorithm we present here, we can impose a structure on the encoding matrix which enables significant reduction in the number of multiplications to enable efficient encoding. Our method provides from 25% to over 90% reduction in the number of multiplications depending on the code attributes.","","978-1-4577-1052-0","10.1109/NCA.2011.52","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6038621","Application software;Decoding;Encoding;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Cloud computing;Reed-Solomon codes","Encoding;Reed-Solomon codes;Mathematical model;Equations;Decoding;Reliability","decoding;encoding;Galois fields;Reed-Solomon codes;reliability","generalized Reed Solomon codes;encoding matrix;reliability;computer systems;data storage;data communications;decoding;Galois fields","","","","6","","10 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Much effort has been invested to mimic RGC and get insight into RGC signals to reconstruct stimuli. However, there remain two challenges. On the one hand, complex nonlinear processes in retinal neural circuits hinder encoding models from enhancing their ability to fit the natural stimuli and modelling RGCs accurately. On the other hand, current research of the decoding process is separate from that of the encoding process, in which the liaison of mutual promotion between them is neglected. In order to alleviate the above problems, we propose a cross-modal dual deep generative model (CDDG) in this paper. CDDG treats the RGC spike signals and the stimuli as two modalities, which learns a shared latent representation for the concatenated modality and two modal-specific latent representations. Then, it imposes distribution consistency restriction on different latent space, cross-consistency and cycle-consistency constraints on the generated variables. Thus, our model ensures cross-modal generation from RGC spike signals to stimuli and vice versa. In our framework, the generation from stimuli to RGC spike signals is equivalent to neural encoding while the inverse process is equivalent to neural decoding. Hence, the proposed method integrates neural encoding and decoding and exploits the reciprocity between them. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve excellent encoding and decoding performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods on three salamander RGC spike datasets with natural stimuli.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207466","dual learning;cross-modal generation;retinal ganglion cells;neural encoding;neural decoding","Decoding;Encoding;Retina;Visualization;Brain modeling;Image reconstruction;Bidirectional control","bioelectric phenomena;brain;decoding;encoding;eye;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","complex nonlinear processes;retinal neural circuits;encoding models;natural stimuli;decoding process;encoding process;cross-modal dual deep generative model;RGC spike signals;concatenated modality;modal-specific latent representations;cross-consistency;cross-modal generation;neural encoding;neural decoding;excellent encoding;decoding performance;salamander RGC spike datasets;simultaneous neural spike encoding;retinal ganglion cells;RGC signals","","","","37","","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
