However, it is not practical because of lack of efficiency. So, methods to reduce the high computational cost of HE is needed. In this paper, we introduce a novel way to evaluate addition circuit under homomorphic encryption circumstances. We apply Ladner-Fischer Carry-Lookahead Addition (CLA) circuit that performs best among all kinds of CLA structure. Moreover, we use Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) technique by organizing several bits packed in one plaintext to further improve performance in the situation where the numbers are larger. This method leads to a reduction of depth and the number of multiplications, achieves 8% increase in speed for 16-bit circuit without SIMD and 63% for 64-bit circuit with SIMD.","","978-1-7281-0286-3","10.1109/EDSSC.2019.8753931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753931","Homomorphic Encryption;Addition Circuit;Carry-Lookahead;SIMD","","adders;carry logic;circuit optimisation;cryptography;data privacy","SIMD;Addition circuit optimization;privacy problem;homomorphic encryption circumstances;CLA structure;improve performance;high computational cost reduction;Ladner-Fischer carry-lookahead addition circuit;single-instruction-multiple-data technique;cloud computing","","","","6","","8 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Security is a very important factor to promote the widespread use of cloud computing. Most of the encryption algorithms are vulnerable to security threats while processing the data stored in the cloud. Homomorphic cryptosystem provides a type of encryption where computations can be performed on the encrypted data without having to decrypt the data first. The results can be decrypted to get the correct plaintext. In this paper, a literature survey is carried out on the different types of homomorphic encryption and their applications. The various works carried out in this area are put together to perform a comparative study. This paper also proposes a security system using fully homomorphic encryption to secure medical data in the cloud.

It is a symmetric key encryption that supports homomorphic operations on encrypted data. We present a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme based on sedenion algebra over finite ℤ<sub>n</sub> rings. The innovation of the scheme is the compression of a 16-dimensional vector for the application of Frobenius automorphism. For sedenion, we have p<sup>16</sup> different possibilities that create a significant bijective mapping over the chosen 16-dimensional vector that adds permutation to our scheme. The security of this scheme is based on the assumption of the hardness of solving a multivariate quadratic equation system over finite ℤ<sub>n</sub> rings. The scheme results in 256n multivariate polynomial equations with 256+16n unknown variables for n messages. For this reason, the proposed scheme serves as a security basis for potentially post-quantum cryptosystems. Moreover, after sedenion, no newly constructed algebra loses its properties. This scheme would therefore apply as a whole to the following algebras, such as 32-dimensional trigintadunion.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3007717","Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9134724","Sedenion;Frobenius automorphism ϕ;automorphism Aut(V);fully homomorphic encryption;totally isotropic subspaces;multivariate polynomial equations","Algebra;Encryption;Zinc;Ciphers;Finite element analysis","cryptography;vectors","multivariate polynomial equations;noise free fully homomorphic encryption scheme;nonassociative algebra;privacy-preserving cryptographic schemes;noise-free homomorphic encryption;symmetric key encryption;data encryption;sedenion algebra;16-dimensional vector;multivariate quadratic equation system;FHE scheme;Frobenius automorphism;post-quantum cryptosystems;32-dimensional trigintadunion","","","","34","CCBY","7 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A critical shortcoming of HE is the high computational complexity of ciphertext arithmetic, especially, HE multiplication (HE Mul). For example, the execution time for computation on encrypted data (ciphertext) increases from 100s to 10,000s of times compared to that on native, unen-crypted messages.

As a result, it is a useful tool with numerous applications. Certificateless encryption (CLE) is a type of public-key encryption that combines the advantages of PKI-based public-key encryption with those of identity-based encryption (IBE). Thus, certificateless fully homomorphic encryption (CLFHE) has aroused considerable research interest. Recently, Chen, Hu, and Lian proposed a leveled certificateless homomorphic encryption (CLHE) scheme and proved its semantic security based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem in the random oracle model. However, their scheme supports only homomorphic addition, but not homomorphic multiplication. In this work, we construct two leveled CLFHE schemes using the approximate eigenvector method presented by Gentry, Sahai, and Waters. Based on the hardness of the LWE problem, we prove that one scheme satisfies adaptive semantic security and anonymity in the random oracle model, whereas the other satisfies selective semantic security and anonymity in the standard model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2971342","Science and Technology Research Project of Higher Education of Hebei Province(grant numbers:ZD2017228); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8979329","Certificateless fully homomorphic encryption;learning with errors;random oracle model;standard model","Encryption;Lattices;Public key;Zinc;Adaptation models;Standards","approximation theory;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;public key cryptography;vectors","certificateless fully homomorphic encryption;leveled certificateless homomorphic encryption scheme;random oracle model;homomorphic addition;homomorphic multiplication;leveled CLFHE schemes;PKI-based public-key encryption;identity-based encryption;IBE;learning with errors;LWE;approximate eigenvector method","","1","","48","CCBY","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Further, this external appliance is used to boost the performance of the Homomorphic operations. Two different approaches for mixing the VOIP data streams required for the teleconference are proposed. In the first approach, the Mixing function for the encrypted VOIP data streams is performed in the SIP Server and the hardware appliance will do only the HE operations.

The reason behind that because it allows computations over encrypted data, without decrypting the original message. This paper developed a new symmetric (FHE) algorithm based on Enhanced Matrix Operation for Randomization and Encryption (EMORE) algorithm using a chaotic system. The proposed algorithm was considered a noise-free algorithm. It generates the ciphertext in a floating-point number's format, overcomes the problem of plaintext ring and modular arithmetic operation in EMORE by the hardness of a chaotic system, and provides another level of security in terms of randomness properties, sensitivity to the initial condition, and large key size (>2<sup>100</sup>) of a chaotic system. Besides that, the proposed algorithm provides the confidentiality and privacy of outsourced data computing through homomorphism property of it. By using both numerical and statistical tests, these tests proved that the proposed algorithm has positive randomness properties and provide secure and reliable encryption (through encryption-decryption time, key sensitivity, keyspace, and correlation). Finally, the simulation results show that the execution time of the proposed algorithm is faster about 7.85 times than the EMORE algorithm.","","978-1-7281-8233-9","10.1109/IT-ELA50150.2020.9253124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9253124","Fully Homomorphic Encryption;EMORE;Chaotic System;Security Analysis;Noise Free","Data privacy;Cloud computing;Symmetric matrices;Sensitivity;Correlation;Encryption;Reliability","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;outsourcing","research topics;secure cloud computing environment;reliable cloud computing environment;encrypted data;symmetric algorithm;FHE;chaotic system;noise-free algorithm;floating-point number;modular arithmetic operation;homomorphism property;positive randomness properties;secure encryption;reliable encryption;encryption-decryption time;EMORE algorithm;noise-free homomorphic encryption;fully homomorphic encryption;enhanced matrix operation;outsourced data computing","","","","26","","13 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data in the untrusted clouds can be encrypted using encryption algorithm. Randomizing this data provides more security which can be achieved by padding concept in the cloud. In this paper, the user's data is encrypted using padding scheme, called Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) together with Hybrid Encryption algorithm that is based on RSA (i.e., HE-RSA), in order to allow multiple parties to compute a function on their inputs while preserving Integrity and Confidentiality. The Homomorphic Encryption(HE) is performed on the encrypted data without decrypting it in computationally powerful clouds and the Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) can be used in the cloud to ensure security and privacy of the users. In this paper, we have proposed a scheme that integrates the multi-party computation with homomorphic encryption to allow calculations of encrypted data without decryption.

In this paper we present our year long effort to design a domain specific architecture in a heterogeneous Arm+FPGA platform to accelerate homomorphic computing on encrypted data. We design a custom co-processor for the computationally expensive operations of the well-known Fan-Vercauteren (FV) homomorphic encryption scheme on the FPGA, and make the Arm processor a server for executing different homomorphic applications in the cloud, using this FPGA-based co-processor. We use the most recent arithmetic and algorithmic optimization techniques and perform design-space exploration on different levels of the implementation hierarchy. In particular we apply circuit-level and block-level pipeline strategies to boost the clock frequency and increase the throughput respectively. To reduce computation latency, we use parallel processing at all levels. Starting from the highly optimized building blocks, we gradually build our multi-core multi-processor architecture for computing. We implemented and tested our optimized domain specific programmable architecture on a single Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU102 Evaluation Kit.

Homomorphic encryption is a desirable technology to be used for this application because it is non-interactive. However, privacy-preserving genome sequence search using homomorphic encryption has been a practical challenge because of scalability issues driven by the depth of computations that need to be supported for privacy-preserving genome sequence search. In this paper, we build off of earlier privacy-preserving genome sequence search results to design, implement and compare two approaches to a client-server style system for privacy-preserving genome sequence search. There is a myriad of options and design trade-offs associated with the application of homomorphic encryption in this domain driven, for example, by choices in data encoding, scheme selection, and even encryption software library. We particularly focus on the use of the BGV and BFV homomorphic encryption schemes provided by the HElib and PALISADE open-source homomorphic encryption software libraries.

Often, patients and organizations are unwilling to divulge personal medical data for fear of compromising their privacy because although the data may be encrypted, the encrypted values typically need to be first decrypted to perform any computation on the data. Unfortunately, such a barrier in easy sharing of data can severely hamper the ability to respond in a timely and effective manner to a crisis scenario, as evident in the case of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To overcome this critical obstacle, we propose in this paper a novel privacy-preserving encryption mechanism for storage and computation of sensitive healthcare data. Our scheme is based on the use of a secure fully homomorphic encryption scheme, so that the required computations can be performed directly on the encrypted data values without the need for any decryption. The ability to execute queries or computation directly on encrypted data, without the need for decryption, is not present in any existing public-health surveillance system. We propose a novel computational model and also develop an algorithm for contact tracing with COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. We have simulated our proposed approach using the ElGamal encryption algorithm to check the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results show that our proposed solution is effective in providing adequate security while supporting the computational needs for contact-tracing. Besides contact-tracing, our new data-encryption technique can have a much broader impact in the field of healthcare. By executing queries or computations directly on encrypted data, our innovative solution would make the sharing of data in healthcare-related research and industry significantly simpler and faster. The use of such a data encryption scheme to store and transmit sensitive healthcare data over a network can not only allay the fear of compromising sensitive information but also ensure HIPAA-compliance.","2153-1684","978-1-7281-9290-1","10.1109/ANTS50601.2020.9342834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9342834","Fully homomorphic encryption;Contact tracing;Healthcare;Privacy-preserving encryption","COVID-19;Industries;Data privacy;Pandemics;Surveillance;Computational modeling;Encryption","cryptography;data acquisition;data privacy;health care;medical information systems","homomorphic encryption based privacy-preserving data acquisition;contact tracing;public health surveillance systems;personal medical data;encrypted values;timely manner;ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;novel privacy-preserving encryption mechanism;sensitive healthcare data;secure fully homomorphic encryption scheme;required computations;encrypted data values;decryption;existing public-health surveillance system;computational model;ElGamal encryption algorithm;contact-tracing;data-encryption technique;data encryption scheme","","","","36","","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nowadays such possibilities for cryptoalgorithm are very important in many areas such as data storage, cloud computing, cryptocurrency, and mush more. In 2009 a system of fully homomorphic encryption was constructed, in the future, many works were done based on it. In this work, is performed the implementation of ideal lattices for constructing homomorphic operations over ciphertexts. The idea, presented in this work, allows to separate relations between homomorphic and security parts of a lattice-based homomorphic encryption system.","2637-9511","978-1-6654-3912-1","10.1109/MECO52532.2021.9460165","Russian Science Foundation(grant numbers:19-19-00566); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9460165","homomorphic encryption;cryptography;information security;lattices","Embedded computing;Cloud computing;Lattices;Memory;Set theory;Encryption;Cryptocurrency","","","","","","12","","1 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a cloud computing scenario, personal information can be processed secretly, inferring a high level of confidentiality. For many years, practical parameters of SHE schemes were overestimated, leading to only consider the FFT algorithm to accelerate SHE in hardware. Nevertheless, recent work demonstrates that parameters can be lowered without compromising the security [1]. Following this trend, this work investigates the benefits of using Karatsuba algorithm instead of FFT for the Fan-Vercauteren (FV) Homomorphic Encryption scheme. The proposed accelerator relies on an hardware/software co-design approach, and is designed to perform fast arithmetic operations on degree 2,560 polynomials with 135 bits coefficients, allowing to compute small algorithms homomorphically. Compared to a functionally equivalent design using FFT, our accelerator performs an homomorphic multiplication in 11.9 ms instead of 15.46 ms, and halves the size of logic utilization and registers on the FPGA.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2016.2645204","French Direction Générale de l'Armement (DGA); European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:643964 (SUPER- CLOUD)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7797469","Homomorphic encryption;SHE;FV;hardware/software co-design;FPGA;karatsuba;implementation","Hardware;Encryption;Acceleration;Software algorithms;Field programmable gate arrays","cryptography;digital arithmetic;fast Fourier transforms;hardware-software codesign;polynomials","accelerator;Karatsuba algorithm;cipher domain;cloud computing scenario;SHE schemes;FFT algorithm;Fan-Vercauteren Homomorphic Encryption scheme;hardware/software co-design approach;fast arithmetic operations;FV homomorphic encryption scheme;somewhat homomorphic encryption;word length 135.0 bit;time 11.9 ms","","12","","29","","26 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
