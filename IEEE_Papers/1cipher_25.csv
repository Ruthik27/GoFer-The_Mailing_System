Cryptography has emerged as a solution that plays an key role in the security of information against malicious attacks. There are various cipher techniques in cryptography, such as monoalphabetic cipher, polyalphabetic cipher, etc. to support data confidentiality as security mechanisms. They are methods of enveloping plain text message into cipher text protecting it from adversaries. The process of encryption of alphabets is the converting original message into non readable form. The Vigenère cipher is one of the most common basic cipher techniques. It is a polyalphabetic cipher technique which uses the Vigenère table for the process of enveloping English alphabets. But Vigenère cipher is longer vulnerable to Kasiski and Friedman attacks based on letter frequency analysis. Thus, in this paper we propose a polyalphabetic cipher that is a new encryption and decryption technique with diffusion and confusion properties based on the concept of the complex cipher used by combining of Vigenère cipher with Affine cipher for the increase of data security in data storage and transmission on public communication networks. Then, our proposed technique is extended by designing based on Myanmar alphabet characters for the increase of data security for Myanmar language. This cipher technique transforms the plain text message in Myanmar alphabet characters into the cipher text in Myanmar alphabet characters using the key in Myanmar alphabet characters.","2329-7190","978-1-5386-8260-9","10.1109/ICCCI.2019.8821797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8821797","Affine cipher;monoalphabetic cipher;polyalphabetic cipher;Vigenère cipher;Myanmar alphabets","Ciphers;Encryption;Informatics;Communication networks;Additives","cryptography","data storage;public communication network;data security;plain text message;cipher text;digital information;information security;cryptography;monoalphabetic cipher;security mechanisms;common basic cipher techniques;encryption;decryption technique;data confidentiality;Vigenere cipher;affine cipher;Myanmar polyalphabetic cipher;complex polyalphabetic cipher technique","","1","","13","","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Every SMS entering a person cellular phone should be considered as a private matter, therefore its privacy as well a security are very important and be kept secret. One popular technique in securing the confidentiality of a message is cryptography whereby a plain message is transformed into an encrypted text. In this paper, we propose a hybrid of two symmetric cryptography algorithms in order to secure messages to be sent on an Android device. Algorithm to encrypt and to decrypt the message is RC4 cipher, while the algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the RC4 key is Affine cipher. The sender firstly encrypts the message to be sent and then encrypts the key. Both the cipher text and the cypher key are sent to the receiver. The receiver should decrypt the cipher key before the ciphertext could be decrypted. An Android based application has been built to implement the proposed method and the result obtained showed that the two algorithms provide a consistent encryption result where the length of the message before being encrypted is always the same as the message obtained after decryption.","","978-1-5386-6921-1","10.1109/IAC.2018.8780567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8780567","hybrid cryptography;RC4 cipher;Affine cipher;short message service;Android","Ciphers;Encryption;Smart phones;Message service;Indexes","Android (operating system);cryptography;smart phones","Hybrid RC4;cellular phones;plain message;encrypted text;symmetric cryptography algorithms;RC4 cipher;RC4 key;cipher key;ciphertext;short message service;affine cipher;Android","","1","","12","","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Key challenges in the growth of IoT are related to privacy and security. To avoid any possible malicious attacks, employing cryptosystems is widely recognized as one of the most effective approaches to implement confidentiality, integrity, and message authentication for the security of IoT. In this work, we investigate the security of Authenticated Encryption ciphers and stream cipher by using the improved cube attack. Firstly, we introduce a method to identify good cubes, which leads to the largest-round distinguisher. Our idea is based on the greedy algorithm of finding cubes and the numeric mapping method for estimating the algebraic degree of the NFSR-based cryptosystem. By using this method, we can efficiently explore useful cubes from a large search space. Further, we evaluate the security of several cryptographic primitives against the cube attack by using the SAT model of division property and flag technique, which can make the propagation of division property more accurately. Experiments show that we can obtain some new or improved cryptanalysis on MORUS-640-128, TRIAD, Quartet, TriviA-ck-v2, and Enhanced-bivium.

In this paper, the method of encrypting plaintext in 128-bit blocks using multiple rounds of encryption process, cipher block chaining, and hexadecimal substitution box was used to resolve these limitations of the Hill cipher.

The main drawback of Hill Cipher is selecting the correct encryption key matrix for encryption. If the encryption key matrix is not properly chosen, the generation of decryption key matrix i.e. the inverse of encryption matrix is not possible. This is because if the encryption key matrix is invertible then only the inverse of encryption matrix is possible. As the selection of key matrix is performed randomly, sometimes it is not obtained correct encryption key matrix using one or two runs. Also there is no deterministic method is available in generating the key matrix. In order to avoid, this paper uses any one of the classical cipher viz., Playfair Cipher, ADFGVX Cipher etc. For that, plaintext and key are accepted as input where the plaintext chosen in this case is not the original plaintext to be encrypted as the ciphertext but it is the text which is only for generating the key and the positional value of the ciphertext is taken as numbers for the encryption key matrix for Hill Cipher. The novelty used in this paper that the key matrix is not generated randomly but its generated using sequential advancement and permutated predetermined procedures.","","978-1-5090-5573-9","10.1109/WCCCT.2016.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8074491","Hill cipher;sequential cipher;permutated cipher and key matrix","Ciphers;Encryption;Public key;Communications technology;Computer science","cryptography;matrix algebra;telecommunication security","Hill Cipher encryption;Hill cipher encryption;polygraph cipher;ciphertext;ADFGVX cipher;Playfair cipher;decryption key matrix generation;classical cipher;encryption key matrix","","1","","8","","19 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Chosen-plaintext attack can be possible on Toorani and Falahati Hill Cipher Algorithm by two closely related variants of Hill Cipher. In this paper we have presented a new approach of Hill Cipher (RDHill Cipher) using DNA cryptography and TFHill Cipher to overcome the drawbacks of TFHill. We implement this algorithm for image encryption in which firstly the image will be converted into binary value and the nibble of binary value will be rotated, then it will be converted into DNA, and then DNA to Amino Acids. Secondly TFHill Cipher can be applied on Amino Acids. The output is measured for the security level based on Correlation, histogram and entropy. The experimental results showed that the combination technique resulted in a higher entropy value and lower correlation, and a more uniform histogram, compared to the Hill Cipher, affine Hill, TFHill and SVK Hill Cipher. This implies the good quality of the retrieved image compared to the original one.","","978-1-4799-3358-7","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6949981","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949981","Decryption;Hill Cipher;Image Encryption;Advanced Hill Cipher;Affine Hill Cipher;SVK Hill Cipher;TF Hill Cipher;DNA Cryptography","Manganese;Ciphers;DNA;Encryption;PSNR;Hafnium compounds","biocomputing;cryptography;entropy;image coding","hybrid approach;image encryption;DNA cryptography;TF Hill cipher algorithm;symmetric key algorithm;plaintext block;chosen-plaintext attack;Toorani-Falahati Hill cipher algorithm;RDHill cipher;image conversion;binary value;amino acids;security level;correlation;histogram;entropy value;affine Hill;TFHill;SVK Hill cipher;image quality","","7","","25","","10 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Symmetric cryptographic algorithms have been proposed to protect the information of the senders and receivers through mobile systems. There are various symmetric cryptographic algorithms such as KASUMI cipher, SNOW cipher, ZUC cipher, and AES cipher have been developed for achieving secure mobile communication systems. Some cryptanalysis techniques (e.g. Sandwich Cryptanalysis Technique, Sliding Property Technique, Differential Cryptanalysis Technique, and Biclique Cryptanalysis Technique) can be used to attack these symmetric ciphers, therefore there is a need for more analysis studies to address the security problems of these ciphers.
