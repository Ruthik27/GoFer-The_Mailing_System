This kind of encryption is called FPE (Format Preserving Encryption) or DPE (Datatype Preserving Encryption). For example, in the case of PCS (Physical Coding Sublayer) at Gigabit Ethernet optical communications, the 8b10b symbol flow can be encrypted at line rate thanks to a symmetric encryption scheme that must preserve the format and coding properties of 8b10b symbols. In this case, since a high speed data flow needs to be encrypted preserving its format, the usage of an FPE stream cipher could be advantageous. For this purpose, a new keystream generator scheme is proposed in this work. It is based on a secure block cipher working in CTR (Counter) mode whose output is subjected to a modulo operation. Moreover, a security analysis for this mode is carried out, deriving an expression for the IND-CPA (Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack) advantage of any adversary, concluding that this mode can be considered secure in the same way as traditional modes are. Furthermore, the proposed structure has been implemented over an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) device and adapted to a Gigabit Ethernet application.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181191","FPE (Format Preserving Encryption);IND-CPA (Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack);stream cipher;FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array)","Games;Ciphers;Encryption;Field programmable gate arrays;Encoding","cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;local area networks","coding properties;high speed data;keystream generator scheme;secure block cipher;CTR mode;datatype preserving encryption;symmetric encryption scheme;line rate thanks;8b10b symbol flow;Gigabit Ethernet optical communications;physical coding sublayer;format preserving encryption;encrypted data;encryption systems;FPE stream cipher;security analysis","","","","12","","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Steganography has been used to hide secret messages in various types of files, including digital images, audio and video. In Image Steganography, secret communication is achieved through embedding a Message Image into a Cover Image. But some general Steganography techniques like LSB, Pixel value Differencing are prone to Information theft. In this paper, the LSB based Image Steganography is combined with two newly proposed Cryptography techniques. The two Cryptography techniques proposed are: Vigenère-AES Cipher and Modified Interrupt Key. Vigenère-AES Cipher Steganography performs a Vigenère Cipher on the Message Image followed by AES Cipher. This Cryptographed Image is then embedded inside the Cover Image using an LSB Lossless Steganographic technique. The Modified Interrupt Key Steganography performs an Interrupt Key based Cryptography on the Message Image. The Cryptographed image is then embedded inside the Cover Image using an LSB Lossless Steganographic technique. The results of these techniques are more secured form of Information hiding as they use Stego-Keys. The Stego-Keys are transmitted securely using a Diffie- Hellman Key Exchange technique.","","978-1-5386-7278-5","10.1109/PUNECON.2018.8745393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8745393","LSB- Least Significant Bit;AES- Advanced Encryption Standard;Vigenère Cipher","","cryptography;image coding;steganography","Modified Interrupt Key-AES Cipher;secret messages;digital images;Image Steganography;Message Image;Cover Image;Cryptography techniques;LSB Lossless Steganographic technique;Modified Interrupt Key Steganography;Cryptographed image;Information hiding;secret communication;pixel value differencing;modified Vigenere-AES cipher;Diffie-Hellman key exchange technique;Vigenere-AES cipher steganography;stego-keys","","","","16","","27 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is due to the complexity of determining matrix inverses when high order matrices are involved. Matrix inverses are required during decryption. This paper proposes an approach for generating invertible high order matrix keys for the Hill cipher. The Hill cipher uses a matrix key of order n x n for encryption, and its inverse is required for decryption. Increasing the order of the matrices used as keys in the Hill cipher undoubtedly strengthen the Hill encryption algorithm. When we increase the order of the matrices, the Hill cipher is more complex to decode as it would be hard to find the inverse matrices, hence hard to break. The proposed approach generates invertible high order matrix keys sequentially within a chosen order. However, the choice of an order is flexible. The actual key to be used is dynamically selected from a pool of candidate matrix keys. Our system for generating high order matrix keys was repeatedly run for several times, generating invertible high order matrices that are successfully pooled. The system also successfully randomly selected one matrix key from the pool. This approach eliminates repeated use of the same matrix key over and over. It strengthens the Hill cipher algorithm by complicating obvious brute force attacks. The algorithm's performances are anticipated to outclass those of the original Hill model.","","978-1-7281-9520-9","10.1109/IMITEC50163.2020.9334140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9334140","Hill cipher;High order matrices","Ciphers;Scalability;Robustness;Encryption;Personnel;Information technology;Testing","cryptography;matrix inversion","invertible high order matrices;Hill cipher algorithm;invertible high order matrix keys;low order matrix keys;matrix inverses;candidate matrix keys","","","","14","","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stream cipher systems depend on Pseudo-Random (P.R.) binary key sequences which are mixed with the plaintexts using addition with modulo two to produce the ciphertexts. The PR key sequences are characterized by three properties which are complexity, period, and randomness. In order to determine the Complexity degree of these Pseudo-Random sequences, many methods and techniques were used, like statistical method, Berlekamp-Massey method, information theory parameters method, and software computing techniques (Fuzzy logic, Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, and Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System -ANFIS-). The main aim of this paper is to use a proposed method to determine the complexity degree of these Pseudo-Random sequences using one of the properties of the Z-transform, which is periodic sequence property. This proposed method enables the researchers to compute the complexity degree of any periodic sequence produced from linear or nonlinear generators, and accurate results are obtained. The steps of the proposed procedure are given, two different examples are illustrated one of them for a P.R. sequence over G.F. (2), and the second example for P.R. sequence over G.F.

In this paper, we present a novel visual cryptography scheme based on a substitution cipher and random grid. The scheme uses two-fold encryption. In the first fold of encryption, Caeser cipher is used to encrypt the image row wise and then column wise using a key of the size equal to the greatest common devisor of the number of rows and columns in the secret image.

The provision of individual data output enables multiple cores to process and output data from each core independently. The individual characteristics of multiple hardware resources enhances data ciphering speed and outputs individual streams of cipher text. After enciphering, full text data are partitioned equally into separate, individual cipher text streams, each being equivalent to a separate, individual copy of cipher text. In the data encryption with block ciphers area, a feedback-data mode of operation such as CBC is the more favored block ciphering mode. However, due to it needs the previous block of data to find out the current block of cipher text, feedback-data mode could not encrypt each plaintext independently, so that it does not work with the multiple cores system.

They were designed to provide security in resource constrained devices like smart cards, IoT devices, RFID tags and wireless sensor networks. After a literature survey on the existing ciphers, Rectangle cipher was chosen for implementation analysis and a variant of it is introduced. The Rectangle cipher is a lightweight cipher which is much similar to AES and incorporates bit slice technique by Zhang, et al in 2015. In this paper we discuss the implementation analysis of Rectangle cipher and an increased block size variant of it. Both the ciphers were implemented on low cost Xilinx Spartan 3E XC3S1200EFG. The synthesis reports were compared with each other and it was found that the variant has slightly degraded performance than the existing Rectangle cipher, but it is well suited for cipher block chaining.","","978-1-5386-2440-1","10.1109/RTEICT42901.2018.9012154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9012154","Cryptography;lightweight cipher;lightweight block ciphers;Rectangle;variant","Ciphers;Matrices;Hardware;Matrix converters;Encryption","private key cryptography;resource allocation","lightweight cipher;symmetric cryptographic systems;cipher block chaining;Rectangle cipher;Xilinx Spartan 3E XC3S1200EFG","","2","","36","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An experimental simple 8-bit substitution-permutation cipher is considered. The neural network is a three-layer perceptron with forward propagation. The required volume of the training sample, the probability of an error after training, and the dependence of these parameters on the number of rounds of the encryption transformation are analyzed. One of the main results is conclusion that the considered model did not show an explicit dependence of the complexity of cryptanalysis using neural networks on the number of rounds in the encryption transformation. Thus the question of the optimality of the chosen neural networks architecture for the selected cipher remained open.","","978-1-7281-9177-5","10.1109/PICST51311.2020.9467945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9467945","block symmetric ciphers;cryptographic strength;cryptanalysis;neural network;perceptron;multilayer perceptron;training set","Training;Ciphers;Neurons;Artificial neural networks;Multilayer perceptrons;Encryption;Complexity theory","cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture;probability","cryptanalysis;artificial neural network;neural network training;plaintext-ciphertext pairs;unknown secret key;three-layer perceptron;forward propagation;required volume;training sample;encryption transformation;neural networks architecture;selected cipher;substitution-permutation cipher;encrypted messages decryption","","","","10","","2 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Dynamic power has been used as a source for many well-known side-channel attack algorithms. As process technology size shrinks, the relative amount of static power consumption increases accordingly, and reaches a significant level in sub-100-nm chips, potentially changing the nature of side-channel analysis. In this paper we propose a type of template attack developed for static power analysis of block ciphers. In addition to the original template distinguisher, the attack is shown to work well using new distinguishers which are faster to compute.","1558-3899","978-1-5090-6389-5","10.1109/MWSCAS.2017.8053158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8053158","side-channel attacks;static power;block ciphers;light-weight ciphers;cryptographic devices","Ciphers;Clocks;Covariance matrices;Power demand;Performance evaluation;Gaussian distribution","CMOS integrated circuits;cryptography;power consumption","template attack;static power analysis;block ciphers;CMOS environment;cryptographic devices;dynamic power;side-channel attack algorithms;side-channel analysis;static power consumption","","1","","19","","2 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For encrypting multimedia one of the core requirements is that the scheme should be computationally less expensive so as to sustain the bulkiness attributed to multimedia. Though, PRESENT is a very lightweight block cipher and is found efficient for textual content yet it is not directly suitable for multimedia. This is because of its block-size limitation which limits the diffusion of redundancy within the block of plaintext encrypted. Hence, if the redundancy extends beyond the block size, the same redundancy gets reflected in the cipher and this is a situation which is practically present in all forms of multimedia. Thus, an attempt is made to overcome this limitation by introducing chaos within the operations performed during encryption. And along with this, focus is kept that the overall computational expense of the improved scheme is not increased much.","","978-1-4799-6042-2","10.1109/POWERI.2014.7117735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7117735","image encryption;block cipher;chaos;lightweight;efficiency","Ciphers;Multimedia communication;Redundancy;Chaos;Entropy","cryptography;multimedia communication;redundancy","multimedia security;block cipher PRESENT;lightweight block cipher;block-size limitation;redundancy diffusion;plaintext encryption","","1","","10","","4 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed algorithm works as follows: (i0 converting the external key into initial value, (ii) using he initial value to generate a key stream using chaotic logistic map function, and (iii) processing a permutation and the result is then XOR-ed with bytes stream of digital image. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm (i) is able to make the cipher-image can not be visually identified, (ii) can eliminate the statistical correlation between the plain-image and cipher-image, (iii) is very sensitive to small changes of key, and (iv) has no change in image contents (lossless encryption) during encryption and decryption process which is indicated by the hash value (MD5) of plain-image has the same hash value (MD5) wth decrypted image.","","978-1-4799-0425-9","10.1109/ICITEED.2013.6676220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6676220","RC4 Stream Cipher;Chaotic Logistics Map;Digital Image Encryption","Encryption;Color;Ciphers","chaos;correlation methods;cryptography;image colour analysis;statistical analysis","digital color image encryption;RC4 stream cipher algorithm;chaotic logistic map function;digital image transmission;Internet;secure protection;illegal copying;data encryption methods;DES;RSA;AES;key stream generation;external key conversion;permutation processing;statistical correlation elimination;plain-image;cipher-image;lossless encryption;decryption process;hash value;MD5","","4","","11","","2 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
