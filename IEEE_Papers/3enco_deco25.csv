The encoding of a cyclic code is performed on a collection of codewords which are mapped through composition, Hadamard permutations, and GFT into a codeword in an LDPC code with a binary parity-check matrix for transmission. Using this matrix, binary iterative decoding is applied to jointly decode a collection of codewords in the cyclic code. The joint-decoding allows reliability information sharing among the received vectors corresponding to the transmitted codewords in the collection during the iterative decoding process. This joint-decoding and information sharing can achieve a joint-decoding gain over the maximum likelihood decoding of individual codewords.

However, under the condition of medium and short code, the communicationeffect of polarization code is not ideal. To solve this problem, a de-coding based on HARQ technology is proposed. The algorithm adds feedback retransmission based on CA-SCL decoding, and retransmits some information bits by using a highly polarized channel, which can compensate for the problem that channel polarization is not sufficient in the case of medium and short codes, and reduces the bit error rate. However, adding a retransmission will increase the decoding delay. Therefore, the algorithm is applicable to scenarios with low latency requirements. Through theoretical analysis and MATLAB simulation, when N=256, when the bit error rate is 0.01, the improved algorithm obtains a gain of 0.5dB compared with the CA-SCL decoding algorithm. The decoding performance of the improved algorithm is verified under different code lengths. It can be seen that as the code length increases, the advantage of the improved algorithm is gradually reduced. Therefore, the algorithm is more suitable for short code.","","978-1-5386-6243-4","10.1109/ITNEC.2019.8729289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8729289","Polarization code;Shannon limit;CRC-SCL decoding;HARQ;channel polarization","Automation;Conferences","5G mobile communication;automatic repeat request;channel coding;decoding;error statistics;feedback","polarization code encoding;HARQ technology;5G control channel coding scheme;information bits;highly polarized channel;channel polarization;bit error rate;decoding delay;CA-SCL decoding algorithm;decoding performance;code length;feedback retransmission;gain 0.5 dB","","","","6","","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DSPs serve as functional models of processing of stimuli up to and including the neuron's active dendritic tree. BSGs model spike generation at the axon hillock level where neurons respond to aggregated synaptic currents. The highly nonlinear behavior of BSGs calls for novel methods of input/output (I/O) analysis of neural encoding circuits and novel decoding algorithms for signal recovery. On the encoding side we characterize the BSG I/O with a phase response curve (PRC) manifold and interpret neural encoding as generalized sampling. We provide a decoding algorithm that recovers visual stimuli encoded by a neural circuit with intrinsic noise sources. In the absence of noise, we give conditions on perfect reconstruction of natural visual scenes. We extend the architecture to encompass neuron models with on-off BSGs with self- and cross-feedback. With the help of the PRC manifold, decoding is shown to be tractable even for a wide signal dynamic range. Consequently, bias currents that were essential in the encoding process can largely be reduced or eliminated. Finally, we present examples of massively parallel encoding and decoding of natural visual scenes on a cluster of graphical processing units (GPUs).

Implementing a RAID-6 system relies on some erasure coding schemes, and so far the most representative solutions are EVENODD codes [1], RDP codes [2] and Liberation codes [3], none of which has emerged as a clear ""all-around"" winner. In this paper, we are interested in revealing the undiscovered potential of the Liberation codes, since these codes have the following attractive features: (a) they have the best update performance, (b) they have better scalability, and (c) they are open-sourced and publicly available, as well as the following drawbacks: fair encoding performance and, more importantly, relatively poor decoding performance. Specificly, we present novel optimal encoding and decoding algorithms for the Liberation codes by introducing an alternative, geometric presentation of these codes. The proposed algorithms completely eliminate redundant computations during the encoding and decoding procedures by extracting and reusing common expressions between the two types of parity constraints, and do not involve any matrix operations on which the original algorithms are based. Our experiment results show that compared with the original solution, the proposed encoding and decoding algorithms reduce the number of XOR's by up to 16 percent and 15 ~20 percent respectively, and the encoding and decoding throughputs are increased by 22.3 percent and at most 155 percent respectively. Moreover, the encoding complexity reaches the theoretical lower bound, while the decoding complexity is also very close to the theoretical lower bound.","1530-2075","978-1-7281-6876-0","10.1109/IPDPS47924.2020.00078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9139777","MDS array codes;RAID-6;reliability;erasure codes","Encoding;Decoding;Arrays;Complexity theory;Measurement;Standards;Reed-Solomon codes","decoding;encoding;error correction codes;RAID;storage management","RAID-6 Liberation codes;RAID-5;disk arrays;RAID-6 system;erasure coding schemes;EVENODD codes;RDP codes;fair encoding performance;optimal encoding;decoding algorithms;decoding procedures;decoding throughputs;encoding complexity;decoding complexity","","1","","24","","14 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, we find that a problem of most proposed coding-aware routing schemes is that they may misidentify the coding opportunities. Specifically, the opportunity misidentification may appear when a packet is about to be re-encoded. We call this the re-encoding problem. To solve this problem, we propose a principle called consistency of encoding and overhearing (CEO). By adhering to CEO, the encoding node is able to avoid misidentifying coding opportunities, thus ensuring the successful decoding of all encoded packets. In this letter, we first show the importance of CEO by analysis in a simple topology. Then, we introduce a distributed way to apply CEO to a coding-aware routing scheme, and show the improved network performance with CEO by simulation in different scenarios.","2162-2345","","10.1109/WCL.2012.122612.120770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6401133","Network coding-aware routing;wireless ad hoc networks;misidentified coding opportunity;re-encoding problem","Encoding;Routing;Decoding;Throughput;Topology;Resource management;Network coding","ad hoc networks;decoding;network coding;performance evaluation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology","CEO;network coding-aware routing;coding opportunity;incoming flow;existing flow;wireless ad hoc networks;coding-aware routing schemes;opportunity misidentification;re-encoding problem;consistency of encoding and overhearing;encoding node;decoding;encoded packets;topology;network performance","","7","","8","","3 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The hardware architecture of an encoding and decoding blocks becomes an attractive issue in designing. Very large scale integration (VLSI) is one of the trending process of integrating thousands of transistors together in a chip and its architecture provides better performance results. When the VLSI architecture involved in the coder design, the system attains effective results in its parameters such as power consumption, speed and area occupied. In general digital systems the Half Cycle Processing Model (HCPM) is totally different which is already exist for FMO/Manchester Codec. Though this model reduces number of transistor count and achieves 100% Hardware Utilization Rate, it induces one cycle latency between positive and negative half cycles. This paper proposes a new Coder design which is integrated with the previous one to resolve this problem.","","978-1-5090-4996-7","10.1109/ICEICE.2017.8191922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8191922","Encoding;decoding;hardware architecture;VLSI","Encoding;Decoding;Very large scale integration;Hardware;Codecs;Xenon;Flip-flops","codecs;data communication;decoding;encoding;VLSI","VLSI architecture;efficient communication;encoding;Decoding schemes;data communications;hardware architecture;decoding blocks;scale integration;coder design;transistor count;negative half cycles;Half Cycle Processing Model;FMO;Manchester Codec;Hardware Utilization Rate","","","","17","","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a consequence of the resulting phase noise, frequent cycle slips may occur in the carrier phase estimation which can be counteracted by the use of differential modulation. To mitigate random transmission errors, state-of-the-art Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes are for large coding gains. The differential decoding penalty due to error doubling can be reduced by iterative demodulation and decoding. For AWGN channels, this penalty is almost entirely recoverable. However, cycle slips induce contradictions of the received channel sequence and the a-priori information from the LDPC decoder in the differential demodulation process leading to non-negligible error floors. We show that using so-called layered LDPC decoding, the number of required iterations for iterative demodulation and decoding can be reduced and the sensitivity towards cycle slips can be improved.","2161-2064","978-1-5090-1467-5","10.1109/ICTON.2016.7550341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7550341","iterative demodulation and decoding;layered LDPC decoding;differential modulation;cycle slips","Iterative decoding;Decoding;Demodulation;Floors;AWGN channels;Encoding","AWGN channels;decoding;optical communication;parity check codes;turbo codes;wavelength division multiplexing","LDPC decoding;turbo-differential decoding;optical communications;wavelength division multiplexing;transmission link;phase noise;low-density parity-check codes;iterative demodulation;iterative decoding;AWGN channels","","","","6","","25 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Source coding operation relies on Multiple Description Coding (MDC) and channel coding uses LDPC codes. To achieve a better quality for the high-quality-requiring user, we consider cooperative communication where another user acts as a relay. We propose a three-dimensions iterative decoding algorithm that exploits the source-relay correlation and the descriptions correlation. We demonstrate how the lossy forwarding process can help the user with bad channel conditions to recover a first quality even at very low source-destination SNRs. If the channel conditions for the second user are fair enough, it is possible to decode the second description, and achieve a very low distortion based on combining the two descriptions. It is also shown that exploiting the residual correlation between the two descriptions can lead to better results especially for medium-to-high SNRs.","","978-1-5386-5795-9","10.1109/CAMA.2018.8530486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8530486","","Iterative decoding;Decoding;Relays;Correlation;Distortion;Encoding","combined source-channel coding;cooperative communication;iterative decoding;relay networks (telecommunication);wireless channels","relay systems;channel coding;decoding method;LDPC codes;source-relay correlation;descriptions correlation;SNR;quality-of-service;source coding;source-channel decoding;MDC-encoded sources","","","","8","","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
