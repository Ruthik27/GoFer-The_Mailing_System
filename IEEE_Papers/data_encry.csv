"Practical Privacy-Preserving Data Science With Homomorphic Encryption: An Overview","M. Iezzi","Bank of Italy,ICT Department,Rome,Italy","2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","19 Mar 2021","2020","","","3979","3988","Privacy has gained a growing interest nowadays due to the increasing and unmanageable amount of produced confidential data. Concerns about the possibility of sharing data with third parties to gain fruitful insights beset enterprise environments; value not only resides in data, but also in the intellectual property of algorithms and models that offer analysis results. This impasse locks both the availability of highperformance computing resources in the ""as-a-service"" paradigm and the exchange of knowledge with the scientific community in a collaborative view. Privacy-preserving data science enables the use of private data and algorithms without putting their privacy at risk. Conventional encryption schemes are not able to work on encrypted data without decrypting them first. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a form of encryption that allows the computation on encrypted data while preserving the features and the format of the plaintext. Against the background of interesting use cases for the Central Bank of Italy, this article focuses on how HE and data science can be leveraged to design and develop privacy-preserving enterprise applications. We propose a survey of main Homomorphic Encryption techniques and recent advances in the conubium between data science and HE.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9377989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377989","Privacy;encryption;data science;machine learning","Privacy;Data privacy;Statistical analysis;Collaboration;Data science;Big Data;Encryption","business communication;cryptography;data privacy","homomorphic encryption techniques;practical privacy-preserving data science;confidential data;enterprise environments;high-performance computing resources;private data;conventional encryption schemes;encrypted data;privacy-preserving enterprise applications;Central Bank of Italy","","","","63","","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To protect the private data, the proposed model uses the BGV encryption scheme to encrypt the private data and employs cloud servers to perform the high-order back-propagation algorithm on the encrypted data efficiently for deep computation model training. Furthermore, the proposed scheme approximates the Sigmoid function as a polynomial function to support the secure computation of the activation function with the BGV encryption. In our scheme, only the encryption operations and the decryption operations are performed by the client while all the computation tasks are performed on the cloud. Experimental results show that our scheme is improved by approximately 2.5 times in the training efficiency compared to the conventional deep computation model without disclosing the private data using the cloud computing including ten nodes.

Big data consists of different formats like structured data and unstructured data; it is not efficient in terms of response time to perform analysis of big data using existing traditional RDBMS techniques. The Big data possess many challenges because of several properties like variety, value, variability, volume, visualization, velocity and veracity. Big data is not allowed to store on one machine due to its collection of enormous datasets so it requires a new distributed platform to analyze and store such huge amount of datasets for future prediction and decision making. Hadoop provides the framework for distributed data processing to analyze and store this large amount of data using commodity hardware. Cloud computing can process the distributed queries across multiple datasets with the use of Hadoop. Big data is stored in the cloud computing environment for processing and analyzing the enormous datasets. Because of this paradigm, many new challenges for securing user's sensitive data, privacy-preserving mechanisms are used in untrusted cloud servers. Privacy-preserving mechanism cryptographically enforced the security to the private data. In this paper, to provide data confidentiality and integrity, three techniques Homomorphic encryption, order-preserving encryption schemes and Attribute-based encryption are described. These techniques can preferably use in the cloud to provide data privacy and also preferred for big data to maintain the efficiency and scalability of large datasets for decision making.","","978-1-5386-7989-0","10.1109/ICACCP.2019.8882922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8882922","MapReduce;Big data;HDFS (Hadoop distributed file system);Cloud computing;Hadoop;Homomorphic encryption (HE) scheme;order-preserving encryption (OPEs);Attribute-based Encryption (ABE)","Encryption;Big Data;Cloud computing;Data privacy;Access control;Servers","Big Data;cloud computing;cryptography;data analysis;data handling;data integrity;data privacy;decision making;query processing;relational databases","data privacy;big data analysis;distributed data processing;privacy-preserving techniques;RDBMS techniques;decision making;Hadoop;cloud computing environment;untrusted cloud servers;homomorphic encryption;order-preserving encryption schemes;attribute-based encryption","","1","","24","","28 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Encryption schemes using digital chaos provide a huge key space which results in high-level security for the user data. Here, a novel physical-layer encryption scheme using chaotic radial constellation rotation is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing PON (OFDM-PON). A one-dimensional (1D) chaos is employed to generate the digital chaotic sequences for data encryption. The proposed encryption scheme offers less computational complexity due to the use of 1D chaos. The initial values are pre-shared between the optical line terminal (OLT) and optical network unit (ONU), which provide a key space of 10<sup>15</sup>. At the OLT, the original data is firstly encrypted by a chaotic XOR operation, and then further encrypted using the chaotic phase offsets. This multi-fold encryption generates an overall key space of 10<sup>30</sup>. The proposed encryption scheme is verified by experiments, where a 9.4-Gb/s encrypted 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) optical OFDM signal transmission is successfully carried over 20 km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). The bit error rate (BER) of the received encrypted signal was calculated for a legitimate ONU as well as an illegal ONU. The encrypted OFDM signal is also compared with the original OFDM signal for performance analysis. The transmission performance is improved for the proposed encryption scheme due to the reason that the introduction of chaotic radial rotation reduces the effect of phase noise in the encrypted OFDM signals.","2151-1411","978-1-5386-3564-3","10.1109/IBCAST.2018.8312262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8312262","Digital Chaos;Data Encryption;Passive Optical Networks (PON);Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM);Bit Error Rate (BER)","Encryption;OFDM;Optical network units;Chaotic communication;Passive optical networks","chaos;cryptography;error statistics;OFDM modulation;optical modulation;passive optical networks;quadrature amplitude modulation","OFDM-PON;physical-layer data encryption schemes;data security;passive optical networks;user data;chaotic radial constellation rotation;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing PON;digital chaotic sequences;optical network unit;multifold encryption;received encrypted signal;chaotic radial rotation;encrypted OFDM signals;quadrature amplitude modulation optical OFDM signal transmission;physical-layer data encryption;one-dimensional chaos;1D chaos;16-QAM;optical line terminal;OLT;ONU;bit error rate;BER;transmission performance","","2","","13","","12 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the proposed scheme provides a HDFS block-splitting component that performs ARIA/AES encryption and decryption under the Hadoop distributed computing environment.

Functional encryption (FE) is a novel cryptographic primitive supporting fine-grained access control of encrypted data in cloud. In FE, every ciphertext is specified with an access policy, a decryptor can access the data if and only if his secret key matches with the access policy. However, the FE cannot be directly applied to construct access control scheme due to the exposure of the access policy which may contain sensitive information. In this paper, we deal with the policy privacy issue and present a mechanism named multi-authority vector policy (MAVP) which provides hidden and expressive access policy for FE. Firstly, each access policy is encoded as a matrix and decryptors can only obtain the matched result from the matrix in MAVP. Then, we design a novel function encryption scheme based on the multi-authority spatial policy (MAVP-FE), which can support privacy-preserving yet non-monotone access policy. Moreover, we greatly improve the efficiency of encryption and decryption in MAVP-FE by shifting the major computation of clients to the outsourced server. Finally, the security and performance analysis show that our MAVP-FE is secure and efficient in practice.","1673-5447","","10.1109/CC.2015.7122471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7122471","cloud storage; data access control;functional encryption; hidden access policy;efficiency","Encryption;Iron;Access control;Privacy;Data privacy","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;storage management","MAVP-FE;multiauthority vector policy functional encryption;decryption;cloud storage;data access control;data security;cryptographic primitive;fine-grained access control;encrypted data;ciphertext;access policy;decryptor;secret key;policy privacy;multiauthority spatial policy;privacy-preserving","","","","","","15 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Instead, attackers rely on myriad techniques that take advantage of operating systems features, use insider access, exploit human weaknesses, or obtain information through social engineering etc. There is a need for an additional layer or parameter to be added along with the strong cryptography algorithm to make the information transfer more secure. Researchers have suggested the use of location as an additional parameter to increase the strength of the key and hence increasing the security level. For example the incidences like board examination or university question papers leak cases happened in recent years has also proved the need of location restricted encryption and decryption system. Hence, a location based encryption technique, viz. Geo-encryption is proposed here to provide an additional security level over the conventional encryption techniques. It involves using receiver's location and time as the key parameters for encryption with strong cryptography algorithms. In this paper, two methods are proposed to increase the strength of the key by including the location information of receiver along with Toleration Distance (TD) and Armstrong number. Also, as both the methods are having their own perspective of handling the problem, the comparison between them is given. Thus the paper proposes an improvement in the traditional geo-encryption algorithm by increasing the strength of the key and providing higher security level for information transfer.","","978-1-7281-4042-1","10.1109/ICCUBEA47591.2019.9129586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9129586","Geo-Encryption;data security;location based encryption","","cryptography;operating systems (computers);security of data;telecommunication security","traditional geo-encryption algorithm;providing higher security level;information transfer;location based encryption technique;data security;computer security;brute force attack;myriad techniques;additional layer;strong cryptography algorithm;additional parameter;location restricted encryption;additional security level;conventional encryption techniques;location information","","","","12","","30 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A reversible data hiding through encryption scheme is already proposed and the existing scheme achieved to obtain good embedding rate with very less bit error rate. In this paper, we modified the existing reversible data hiding through a novel encryption process to improve the embedding rate by a factor of three without compromising the bit error rate.

Nevertheless, as the client information data is stored in the cloud provider servers, the confidentiality of the information become a new concern. Different algorithms based on Encryption is presented previously to provide cloud clients with confidentiality. The main idea of encryption algorithms for cloud data is to permit cloud clients queries to be handled using encrypted data without decryption. This paper presents a new security mechanism using hybrid method of encryption algorithms and a distribution system to enhance cloud database confidentiality. A vertical fragmentation technique is adopted from alsirhani's model for distributing data over clouds. However, to overcome a weakness in alsirhani's model where compromises to a fragment can still make data meaningful. Instead, the proposed model uses a hybrid fragmentation technique to make data on fragments meaningless if compromised. The proposed model distributes the cloud database among the clouds using the provider views and level of confidentiality that is delivered by the employed encryption algorithms. To evaluate the proposed searchable encryption and hybrid fragmentation model, the study developed a Java application for simulating the hybrid cloud. The simulation combines public and private clouds; as essential processes is conducted inside the private cloud. The evaluation of the work was conducted by comparing the proposed model with existing solutions in query response and security characteristics. Preliminary results showed that the proposed searchable encryption and hybrid fragmentation model provides a secure mechanism that enhances data confidentiality in terms of faster response and additional security.","","978-1-7281-1006-6","10.1109/ICCCEEE46830.2019.9070918","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9070918","Cloud computing;Isolation;Encryption;Distributed systems;Hybrid fragmentation.","Cloud computing;Encryption;Databases;Data models;Computational modeling;Servers","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;database management systems;Java;query processing","personal computers;cloud servers;client information data;cloud provider servers;cloud clients queries;encrypted data;security mechanism;cloud database confidentiality;vertical fragmentation;encryption algorithms;searchable encryption;hybrid cloud;private cloud;query response;security characteristics;secure mechanism;data confidentiality;cloud data security;cloud computing;computing process;hybrid fragmentation;Java application","","","","21","","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The time execution of encrypting data is one of the serious issues during the processes of data processing and transmissions. Many current applications abandon data encryptions in order to reach an adoptive performance level, companions with privacy concerns. In this paper, we concentrate on privacy issue and propose a novel data encryption approach, named as Dynamic Data Encryption Strategy (D2ES). Our proposed approach aims to selectively encrypt data using privacy classification methods under timing constraints. This approach is designed to maximize the privacy protection scope by using a selective encryption strategy within the required execution time requirements.

Data mining requires massive data as a support. However, the direct release of the original mass data, which usually contain some sensitive information of personal or analysis, will result in leakage of user privacy. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to protect privacy information in data publishing. In this paper, we focus on the multi-type self-identified format-preserving encryption. First, we introduce a multi-type self-identified format-preserving encryption system and discuss the encryption of various types of data in this system. Then, for the format preserving encryption (FPE) about Chinese name, we study from the encryption model construction and basic encryption scheme. The format-preserving encryption model about Chinese name is constructed and the concept of the name library is presented. Based on this, it is used to not only limit the message space to reduce complexity, but also ensure the cipher in accordance with the Chinese naming habits. In addition, according to the encryption and decryption model, format-preserving encryption process of Chinese name is designed. In order to add new names, the algorithm of name space expansion is proposed. Based on the Prefix, this paper put forward an algorithm named Cycle-Prefix, which enhances the security and dynamics of FPE by using two adjustment factors and the circular encryption. Compared with the traditional Prefix algorithm, experiments show that Cycle-Prefix can not only complete the task of FPE for Chinese name, but also encrypt same plain text into different ciphers under the premise of similar efficiency with Prefix.","1673-5447","","10.1109/CC.2018.8331992","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8331992","Chinese name;format-preserving encryption;name library;encryption model","Encryption;Communication systems;Erbium;Ciphers;Libraries","cryptography;data mining;data privacy","personal digital information;data mining;original mass data;privacy information;data publishing;encryption system;encryption model construction;Chinese naming habits;encryption process;name space expansion;Cycle-Prefix;circular encryption;Big Data;FPE;format preserving encryption","","1","","","","5 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Encryption is the best use to keep data safe from malicious users. However, ordinary encryption methods are not suitable for big data. Selective encryption is an encryption method that encrypts only the important part of the message. However, we deal with uncertainty to evaluate the important part of the message. The problem arises when the important part is not encrypted. This is the motivation of the paper. In this paper we propose security framework to secure important and unimportant portion of the message to overcome the uncertainty. However, each will take a different encryption technique for better performance without losing security. The framework selects the important parts of the message to be encrypted with a strong algorithm and the weak part with a medium algorithm. The important of the word is defined according to how its origin frequently appears. This framework is applied on amazon EC2 (elastic compute cloud).

At the same time, security and privacy concerns for the data are growing. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) enables both data security and access control by defining users with attributes so that only those users who have matching attributes can decrypt them. For real-world applications of ABE, revocation of users or their attributes is necessary so that revoked users can no longer decrypt the data. In actual implementations, ABE is used in hybrid with a symmetric encryption scheme such as the advanced encryption standard (AES) where data is encrypted with AES and the AES key is encrypted with ABE. The hybrid encryption scheme requires re-encryption of the data upon revocation to ensure that the revoked users can no longer decrypt that data. To re-encrypt the data, the data owner (DO) must download the data from the cloud, then decrypt, encrypt, and upload the data back to the cloud, resulting in both huge communication costs and computational burden on the DO depending on the size of the data to be re-encrypted. In this paper, we propose an attribute-based proxy re-encryption method in which data can be re-encrypted in the cloud without downloading any data by adopting both ABE and Syalim's encryption scheme.

Homomorphic encryption enables cloud computing to perform the operations on the encrypted cloud data. Fully-homomorphic encryption supports to perform multiple types of operations on encrypted cloud data. But performing the fully-homomorphic encryption (computations on encrypted cloud data) on a single node or in sequential process took the more processing time and memory than the performing the same operations on the plain text (unencrypted data). Parallel processing enables to perform operations on multiple nodes it will take lesser time to complete the applied operation than the sequential process.

Many such devices sense the deployed environment and generate a variety of data and send them to the server for analysis as data streams. A Data Stream Manager (DSM) at the server collects the data streams (often called big data) to perform real time analysis and decision-making for these critical applications. A malicious adversary may access or tamper with the data in transit. One of the challenging tasks in such applications is to assure the trustworthiness of the collected data so that any decisions are made on the processing of correct data. Assuring high data trustworthiness requires that the system satisfies two key security properties: confidentiality and integrity. To ensure the confidentiality of collected data, we need to prevent sensitive information from reaching the wrong people by ensuring that the right people are getting it. Sensed data are always associated with different sensitivity levels based on the sensitivity of emerging applications or the sensed data types or the sensing devices. For example, a temperature in a precision agriculture application may not be as sensitive as monitored data in smart health. Providing multilevel data confidentiality along with data integrity for big sensing data streams in the context of near real time analytics is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a Selective Encryption (SEEN) method to secure big sensing data streams that satisfies the desired multiple levels of confidentiality and data integrity. Our method is based on two key concepts: common shared keys that are initialized and updated by DSM without requiring retransmission, and a seamless key refreshment process without interrupting the data stream encryption/decryption. Theoretical analyses and experimental results of our SEEN method show that it can significantly improve the efficiency and buffer usage at DSM without compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the data streams.","2332-7790","","10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2702172","AISRF-08140; ARC(grant numbers:LP140100816); NSF(grant numbers:1652107); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7921576","Big data stream;selective encryption;data confidentiality;data integrity;data security","Big data;Real-time systems;Sensors;Encryption","Big Data;cryptography;data integrity;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","decision-making;selective encryption method;multilevel data confidentiality;resource constrained sensing devices;self-organizing wireless sensor networks;sensed data types;high data trustworthiness;big data;Data Stream Manager;critical applications;big sensing data streams;data integrity;smart health","","10","","50","","8 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Often, patients and organizations are unwilling to divulge personal medical data for fear of compromising their privacy because although the data may be encrypted, the encrypted values typically need to be first decrypted to perform any computation on the data. Unfortunately, such a barrier in easy sharing of data can severely hamper the ability to respond in a timely and effective manner to a crisis scenario, as evident in the case of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To overcome this critical obstacle, we propose in this paper a novel privacy-preserving encryption mechanism for storage and computation of sensitive healthcare data. Our scheme is based on the use of a secure fully homomorphic encryption scheme, so that the required computations can be performed directly on the encrypted data values without the need for any decryption. The ability to execute queries or computation directly on encrypted data, without the need for decryption, is not present in any existing public-health surveillance system. We propose a novel computational model and also develop an algorithm for contact tracing with COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. We have simulated our proposed approach using the ElGamal encryption algorithm to check the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results show that our proposed solution is effective in providing adequate security while supporting the computational needs for contact-tracing. Besides contact-tracing, our new data-encryption technique can have a much broader impact in the field of healthcare. By executing queries or computations directly on encrypted data, our innovative solution would make the sharing of data in healthcare-related research and industry significantly simpler and faster. The use of such a data encryption scheme to store and transmit sensitive healthcare data over a network can not only allay the fear of compromising sensitive information but also ensure HIPAA-compliance.","2153-1684","978-1-7281-9290-1","10.1109/ANTS50601.2020.9342834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9342834","Fully homomorphic encryption;Contact tracing;Healthcare;Privacy-preserving encryption","COVID-19;Industries;Data privacy;Pandemics;Surveillance;Computational modeling;Encryption","cryptography;data acquisition;data privacy;health care;medical information systems","homomorphic encryption based privacy-preserving data acquisition;contact tracing;public health surveillance systems;personal medical data;encrypted values;timely manner;ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;novel privacy-preserving encryption mechanism;sensitive healthcare data;secure fully homomorphic encryption scheme;required computations;encrypted data values;decryption;existing public-health surveillance system;computational model;ElGamal encryption algorithm;contact-tracing;data-encryption technique;data encryption scheme","","","","36","","8 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the traditional format-preserving encryption desensitization scheme, this paper proposes a general model for the application of identity-based format pre-encryption (IB-FPE) in data desensitization technology. Firstly, the solution preserves the traditional format retention encryption scheme and maintains data integrity efficiently. Secondly, by improving the key generation function, the identity information is associated with the master key, thereby locating and limiting the damage caused by the key exposure to the format retention encryption.

Discovery of hidden relationships and patterns often goes unexploited. Advanced data mining techniques can be a remedy this situation. Personal Health records have raised as a patient centric healthcare services where the patients health information is accumulated on the cloud. It gives an opportunity for the individuals to create, manage and distribute the data on the cloud. But this involves considering the issues of security and privacy. With technological development cloud services are being used widely and comprises of multiple users and owners of this cloud service, thus results in data management complexity. The objective of the paper is to predict Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) using classification techniques and emphasize on the consequences of security and data access control of patient health information in the real time application. To manage huge amount of data, a flexible and fine-grained access control solution should be used. A favorable approach has emerged based on Feature Based Encryption, which provides flexible and fine-grained access control. Complexity of key management can be reduced by distributing users into multiple domains. But keys and data on clouds can be intercepted by semi trusted servers. Therefore Advanced Encryption Standard is used for providing high security of data.","","978-1-5386-3243-7","10.1109/CTCEEC.2017.8455164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8455164","Data mining;Personal Health records;Feature Based Encryption;Chronic kidney disease prediction","Diseases;Encryption;Kidney;Access control;Data mining","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data mining;data privacy;decision making;diseases;health care;kidney;medical information systems","data privacy;Chronic Kidney Disease;Advanced Encryption Standard;Feature Based Encryption;fine-grained access control solution;flexible access control solution;patient health information;classification techniques;data management complexity;cloud service;multiple users;technological development cloud services;security;patients health information;patient centric healthcare services;Personal Health records;Advanced data mining techniques;hidden relationships;valid decision making;hidden information;complex healthcare data;healthcare organization;medical application","","1","","13","","6 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we proposed a novel Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) framework SecureGBM built-up with a multi-party computation model based on semi-homomorphic encryption, where every involved party can jointly obtain a shared Gradient Boosting machines model while protecting their own data from the potential privacy leakage and inferential identification. More specific, our work focused on a specific “dualparty” secure learning scenario based on two parties - both party own an unique view (i.e., attributes or features) to the sample group of samples while only one party owns the labels. In such scenario, feature and label data are not allowed to share with others.To achieve the above goal, we firstly extent - LightGBM - a well known implementation of tree-based GBM through covering its key operations for training and inference with SEAL homomorphic encryption schemes. However, the performance of such re-implementation is significantly bottle-necked by the explosive inflation of the communication payloads, based on ciphertexts subject to the increasing length of plaintexts. In this way, we then proposed to use stochastic approximation techniques to reduced the communication payloads while accelerating the overall training procedure in a statistical manner. Our experiments using the real-world data showed that SecureGBM can well secure the communication and computation of LightGBM training and inference procedures for the both parties while only losing less than 3% AUC, using the same number of iterations for gradient boosting, on a wide range of benchmark datasets. More specific, compared to LightGBM, the proposed SecureGBM would slowdown with 3×~64× time consumption per iteration in the training procedure, while SecureGBM becomes more and more efficient when the scale of the training dataset increases (i.e., the larger training set, the lower slowdown ratio).","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006000","","Boosting;Encryption;Computational modeling;Training;Data models;Classification algorithms","cryptography;data mining;data privacy;distributed databases;learning (artificial intelligence)","secure multiparty Gradient Boosting;federated machine learning systems;joint data analytics;multiparty computation model;semihomomorphic encryption;involved party;shared Gradient Boosting machines model;learning scenario;label data;tree-based GBM;SEAL homomorphic encryption schemes;communication payloads;training procedure;real-world data;inference procedures;training dataset increases;gradient boosting machines framework","","3","","38","","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Attribute-Based Encryption schemes can be effectively used to ensure privacy and security of multidimensional data objects. In order to use such schemes we propose attribute management scheme and access policies. In our paper, it is shown how to convert any access policy to a set of binary trees enabling use of Attribute-Based Encryption for stored multidimensional data cubes. Moreover, we demonstrate that such transformation can be done in a unique way.
