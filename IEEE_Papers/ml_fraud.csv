Both public and private sector enterprises have been collecting and deploying enormous amount of domain-specific information to gain insights about areas like security, marketing, forecasting, fraud-detection, strategic planning etc.. This big data potential is unquestionably noteworthy; but to explore it fully and sensibly it requires new ideas and original learning techniques to address challenges associated with it. With the universe being getting more knowledge-based and computerized, an enormous range of applications shows interest in machine learning (ML) techniques. Machine learning is one of the most sought after field to handle big data challenge. With this paper we endow with a literature analysis related to the up-to-the-minute progress in researches on big data processing deploying Machine Learning as an analytical tool. We will review machine learning techniques with a focus on the promising learning methods like transfer learning, active learning, deep learning, representation learning, distributed, kernel-based learning and parallel learning.

This has caused a burst in credit and debit card fraud and has become a profoundly significant global issue. Fraud touches every area of our lives and is a growing concern that effects both businesses and customers. As machine learning techniques provide unique and efficient solutions, they are applicable in various types of problems. Recently, machine learning algorithms have been widely applied as a data mining technique for classification problems. In this paper, a binary classification problem is considered where a transaction can be classified as either fraudulent or legitimate transaction. The goal is to classify the transactions using five different machine learning algorithms. The transaction dataset (Task1 and Task2) is preprocessed, and then SGD, DT, RF, J48 and IBk machine learning classifiers are applied. After applying the classifiers, the results are compared to analyze which classifier performs the best. Based on the experimental results, it is found that the accuracy percentage of all the five classifiers for Task1 and Task2 datasets is ranging between 97.78% to 98.1%, with no major difference. As the dataset is highly imbalanced, the kappa statistic value is also considered. For both datasets, the RF classifier had the greatest value of kappa statistics, whereas SGD and J48 had the lowest value for Task1 and Task2, respectively. Other evaluation metrics were also considered for evaluating the performance of the applied classifiers. Overall, these classifiers achieved similar results for Task2 dataset. As negative Kappa statics and MCC values were obtained, the SGD classifier for Task2 dataset had the worst results in comparison. Based on evaluation criteria such as Kappa statistic and MCC values RF outperformed the others for both the datasets.","","978-1-7281-9673-2","10.1109/3ICT51146.2020.9312025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9312025","classification;credit and debit cards transactions;ML algorithms;imbalanced data;fraud detection","Credit cards;Machine learning algorithms;Task analysis;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Classification algorithms;Decision trees","data mining;electronic commerce;financial data processing;fraud;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","fraudulent transaction detection;online transactions purchases;debit card fraud;profoundly significant global issue;machine learning techniques;data mining technique;classification problems;binary classification problem;legitimate transaction;transaction dataset;IBk machine learning classifiers;Task2 dataset;kappa statistic value;RF classifier;kappa statistics;applied classifiers;MCC values;SGD classifier","","","","37","","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, we propose and evaluate a network based model which uses ensemble Machine Learning (ML) methods in order to identify the mobile threats, by analyzing the network flows of the malware communication. The ensemble ML methods not only protect over-fitting of the model but also cope with the issues related to the changing behavior of the attackers. The focus of this study is on android based mobile malwares due to its popularity among users. We have used ensemble methods to combine output of 5 supervised ML algorithms such as RF, PART, JRIP, J.48 and Ridor.

However, these algorithms are often hard for users to interpret or modify due to their hidden processes. This paper presents an explainable visualization approach to provide a set of developer tools that enable users to apply ML algorithms efficiently without requiring users to understand the algorithms completely. We use an algorithm of convolutional neural network (CNN) for Wikipedia vandal detection as an example. Our highly coordinated visualizations serve as a visual analytics interface for developers to analyze the behaviors of algorithms and large-scale data. It enables users to study hidden relationships among the spaces of data, algorithm parameters, and results that are essential to understand the CNN detection mechanism. We provide several case studies to demonstrate how our approach can be used to explore the clusters of parameter space, identify outlier of parameters or data, study the parameter sensitivity ranges, and select suitable ranges of parameter for combined criteria (e.g., covering selected important cases and maintaining relative high success ratio) that are hard to describe with single objective functions. Due to the complexity of the problem, we also discuss the limitations of our approach and future work.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006128","Explainable visualization;CNN;vandal detection;Wikipedia user behavior","Data visualization;Encyclopedias;Electronic publishing;Internet;Tools;Visualization","convolutional neural nets;data analysis;data visualisation;encyclopaedias;fraud;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;Web sites","algorithm parameters;large-scale data;visual analytics interface;convolutional neural network;ML algorithms;explainable visualization approach;security applications;frauds;machine learning algorithms;Wikipedia vandal detection;interactive exploration;parameter sensitivity ranges;parameter space;CNN detection mechanism","","","","35","","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Those changes generate some variations of the business process. The variations, can be in line with the company's principles and or become an anomaly for the company. These anomalies can cause frauds which make some losses for the company. In order to reduce the losses, business process anomaly detection method is needed. This paper proposed ontology-based process modeling to model and capture the business process anomalies and the method of multi-level class association rule learning (ML-CARL) to detect fraud in business process.

These malicious software programs come in a wide range of different classifications such as viruses, Trojans, worms, spyware, botnet malware, ransomware, Rootkit, etc. Ransomware is class of malware that holds the victim's data hostage by encrypting the data on a user's computer to make it unavailable to the user and only decrypt it after the user pays a ransom in the form of a sum of money. To avoid detection, different variants of ransomware utilise one or more techniques in their attack flow including Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. There is, therefore, a need to understand the techniques used ransomware development and their deployment strategy in order to understand their attack flow better to develop appropriate countermeasures. In this paper, we propose DNAact-Ran, A Digital DNA Sequencing Engine for Ransomware Detection Using Machine Learning. DNAact-Ran utilises Digital DNA sequencing design constraints and k-mer frequency vector. To measure the efficacy of the proposed approach, we evaluated DNAact-Run on 582 ransomware and 942 goodware instances to measure the performance of precision, recall, f-measure and accuracy.

However, the analysis of fraud cases is computationally difficult because, fraud cases conjure less than 0.2% of the transactions. Thus to figure out the best classification technique to use for fraud detection, this paper has conducted a thorough experimentation of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It has implemented six ML techniques i.e. Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naíve Bayes (NB), Random forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and K-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifiers to detect credit card fraud. The investigation used five type of datasets i.e. imbalanced data, Under Sampled (US) data, Over Sampled (OS) data, sampled data using Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Method for Imbalanced Data (ADASYN). The best combination of these classification approaches is selected based on five performance evaluation criteria i.e. Accuracy, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Precision, Recall score and fl-score. After evaluation of the classifiers it has showed that among 30 different classification approaches, RF classifier with over sampling (OS) technique was found to be the best approach in terms of all the performance criteria. It showed 99.99 % accurate and precise results with 99.99 % AUC, fl-score and 100 % Recall rate. Our choosen approach has obtained the highest accuracy over other studies on the same dataset.

Automation in this field of digital forensic investigation is the need of the hour to reduce large interactions with humans and to avoid slowing down of investigation process in the pace of growing digital crimes. The human-like behavior depicted by the Machine Learning (ML) to support automation in digital forensic investigation and to help forensic investigators at various stages of digital investigation is the motivation for the proposed work.

Annual premiums need to be paid by owners to an auto insurance company on regular basis. The insurance company pays all or most of the costs associated with vehicle damage. The insurance sector is a highly regulated industry, and with this increasing competition, it is not at all easy to keep up with the latest technologies. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a promising approach that automates recurring human tasks using software bots. Many organizations use RPA to allay their employees from repetitive and tedious tasks which contributes to achieve many benefits including better business efficiency, larger productivity, data security, reduced cycle time, and improved accuracy. The client’s satisfaction, enhanced and efficient production can be achieved in the organizations with the use of computers for doing repetitive tasks which run in background along with the production processes. These background automation systems are referred as Robotic Process Automation (RPA). It automates the repeating tasks thereby reducing human intervention. RPA is known as a catalyst for the bot revolution. Implementing RPA is a challenge for any organization that is willing to adapt it and must learn to deal with RPA to reach maximum results. Usage of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in the insurance sector facilitates the easy collection of policyholder’s details, essential information from previous years’ claims documents, therefore allowing the insurers to settle insurance claims seamlessly. This paper aims to perform Vehicle Fraud Detection by efficiently adopting Robotic Process Automation in the insurance sector to automate the task of by integrating with Machine Learning (ML) techniques that make the system more intelligent to classify an insurance claim as a fraud or legitimate. The authors found that Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) shown prominent results with an accuracy of 90% compared to other techniques. Finally, future directions are presented.","","978-1-7281-8583-5","10.1109/CONIT51480.2021.9498507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9498507","Vehicle insurance fraud detection;Robotic Process Automation (RPA);Machine Learning;Design Pattern;Legitimate;Fraudulent","Productivity;Industries;Automation;Service robots;Insurance;Machine learning;Companies","","","","","","16","","4 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is vital to create reliable fraud detection systems, including two labels of fraud and no-fraud. However, there are highly unbalanced data between these two labels. In this paper, we use two resampling approaches of synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) to handle an imbalanced dataset to obtain the balanced dataset. The machine learning (ML) algorithms, named random forest, k nearest neighbors, decision tree, and logistic regression are applied to this balanced dataset.

However, current data tools are still primitive when it comes to helping users trace model performance problems all the way to the data. We focus on the particular problem of slicing data to identify subsets of the validation data where the model performs poorly. This is an important problem in model validation because the overall model performance can fail to reflect that of the smaller subsets, and slicing allows users to analyze the model performance on a more granular-level. Unlike general techniques (e.g., clustering) that can find arbitrary slices, our goal is to find interpretable slices (which are easier to take action compared to arbitrary subsets) that are large and problematic. We propose Slice Finder, which is an interactive framework for identifying such slices using statistical techniques. Applications include diagnosing model fairness and fraud detection, where identifying slices that are interpretable to humans is crucial.","2375-026X","978-1-5386-7474-1","10.1109/ICDE.2019.00139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8731353","data slicing;model validation","Data models;Decision trees;Lattices;Search problems;Analytical models;Training;Loss measurement","data mining;fraud;learning (artificial intelligence);program debugging;program slicing;statistical analysis","model performance problems;slicing data;validation data;model validation;arbitrary slices;interpretable slices;arbitrary subsets;Slice Finder;model fairness;automated data slicing;machine learning systems","","3","","11","","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recommender systems decide which jobs, movies, or other user profiles might be interesting to us. Spell checkers help us to make good use of language. Fraud detection systems decide if a credit card transactions should be verified more closely. Many of these decision making systems use machine learning methods that fit complex models to massive datasets. The successful deployment of machine learning (ML) methods to many (critical) application domains crucially depends on its explainability. Indeed, humans have a strong desire to get explanations that resolve the uncertainty about experienced phenomena like the predictions and decisions obtained from ML methods. Explainable ML is challenging since explanations must be tailored (personalized) to individual users with varying backgrounds. Some users might have received university-level education in ML, while other users might have no formal training in linear algebra. Linear regression with few features might be perfectly interpretable for the first group but might be considered a black-box by the latter. We propose a simple probabilistic model for the predictions and user knowledge. This model allows to study explainable ML using information theory. Explaining is here considered as the task of reducing the “surprise” incurred by a prediction. We quantify the effect of an explanation by the conditional mutual information between the explanation and prediction, given the user background.","1558-2361","","10.1109/LSP.2020.2993176","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:ee-IoT project n.319009); FIREMAN(grant numbers:CHIST-ERA/n.326270); EnergyNet Research Fellowship(grant numbers:n.321265/n.328869); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089200","Machine learning;artificial intelligence;decision support systems","Predictive models;Data models;Probabilistic logic;Machine learning;Decision making;Linear regression;Neural networks","decision making;formal verification;fraud;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems","information-theoretic approach;personalized explainable machine learning;automated decision making;recommender systems;user profiles;spell checkers;fraud detection systems;credit card transactions;complex models;massive datasets;explainable ML;university-level education;linear algebra;linear regression;information theory;conditional mutual information;user background","","","","28","IEEE","7 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Whereas data scientists utilize algorithmic models in order to transform datasets and extract actionable knowledge, a key challenge is oriented towards abstracting the underline layers: the ones enabling the management of infrastructure resources and the ones responsible to provide frameworks and components as services. In this sense, the serverless approach features as the novel paradigm of new cloud-related technology, enabling the agile implementation of applications and services. The concept of Function as a Service (FaaS) is introduced as a revolutionary model that offers the means to exploit serverless offerings. Developers have the potential to design their applications with the necessary scalability in the form of nanoservices without addressing themselves the way the infrastructure resources should be deployed and managed. By abstracting away the underlying hardware allocations, the data scientist concentrates on the business logic and critical problems of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. This paper introduces an approach to realize the provision of ML Functions as a Service (i.e., ML-FaaS), by exploiting the Apache OpenWhisk event-driven, distributed serverless platform. The presented approach tackles also composite services that consist of single ones i.e., workflows of ML tasks including processes such as aggregation, cleaning, feature extraction, and analytics; thus, reflecting the complete data path. We also illustrate the operation of the approach mentioned above and assess its performance and effectiveness exploiting a holistic, end-toend anti-fraud detection machine learning pipeline.","2472-8144","978-1-7281-7705-2","10.1109/ICIN51074.2021.9385525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9385525","machine learning;artificial intelligence;serverless;function as a service;cloud computing;edge computing","Pipelines;FAA;Feature extraction;Data models;Task analysis;Pipeline processing;Business","cloud computing;computer network management;data mining;feature extraction;fraud;learning (artificial intelligence);peer-to-peer computing;protocols;Web services","approach tackles;composite services;single ones;ML tasks;feature extraction;complete data path;end-toend anti-fraud detection machine;pipeline;serverless paradigm;edge-cloud continuum;data rate highlighted numerous requirements;added-value;edge resources;data scientists;algorithmic models;actionable knowledge;underline layers;infrastructure resources;serverless approach features;cloud-related technology;agile implementation;revolutionary model;serverless offerings;necessary scalability;underlying hardware allocations;data scientist concentrates;business logic;ML Functions;ML-FaaS;distributed serverless platform","","","","31","","29 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is getting more complicated to identify botnets due to the continuous evolution of botnet software and families that harness new types of devices and attack vectors. Recent studies employing machine learning (ML) showed improved performance to detect botnets to some extent, but they are still limited and ineffective with the lack of sequential pattern analysis, which is a key to detect various classes of botnets. In this paper, we propose a novel botnet detection method, built upon Recurrent Variational Autoencoder (RVAE), that effectively captures sequential characteristics of botnet anomalies. We validate the feasibility of the proposed method with the CTU-13 dataset that have been widely employed for botnet detection studies, and show that our method is at least comparable to existing techniques in terms of detection accuracy. In addition, our experimental results show that the proposed method can detect previously unseen botnets by utilizing sequential patterns of network traffic. We will also show how our method can detect botnets in the streaming mode, which is the essential requirement to perform real-time, on-line detection.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9348169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9348169","botnet detection;anomaly scoring;Recurrent Neural Network;Variational Autoencoder;network security","Training;Systematics;Botnet;Unsolicited e-mail;Telecommunication traffic;Detectors;Anomaly detection","fraud;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;unsolicited e-mail","botnet detection method;recurrent variational autoencoder;botnet anomalies;botnet detection studies;unseen botnets;online detection;click-fraud;botnet software;RVAE;CTU-13 dataset;distributed denial-of-service;spamming;crypto-mining attacks;machine learning;DDoS","","","","26","","11 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions on a timely basis is a very critical and challenging problem in Financial Industry. Although online transactions are very convenient, they bring the risk of fraudulence on many aspects. Some of the key challenges in detecting fraudulence in online transactions include irregular behavioral patterns, skewed dataset i.e. high normal transaction to fraudulent transaction ratio, limited availability of data and dynamically changing environment. Every year people lose millions of dollars due to credit card fraud. There is a lack of quality research in this domain. We have used a dataset comprising of European cardholders which has 284,807 transactions to model our system. In this paper, we will design and develop credit card fraudulence detection system by training and testing two ML algorithms: Decision Forest (DF) and Decision Jungle (DJ) classifiers.

In the fraud detection task, typically the available datasets for ML training present some peculiarities, such as the unavoidable condition of a strong class imbalance, the existence of unlabeled transactions, and the large number of records that must be processed. The present paper aims to propose a methodology for automatic detection of fraudulent transactions, that tackle all these problems. The methodology is based on a Balanced Random Forest, that can be used in supervised and semi-supervised scenarios through a co-training approach. Two different schemes for the co-training approach are tested, in order to overcome the class imbalance problem. Moreover, a Spark platform and Hadoop file system support our solution, in order to enable the scalability of the proposed solution. The proposed approach achieves an absolute improvement of around 24% in terms of geometric mean in comparison to a standard random forest learning strategy.","","978-1-5386-1060-2","10.1109/ColComCon.2017.8088206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8088206","Fraud Detection;Machine Learning;Random Forest;Semi-supervised Learning;Spark","Radio frequency;Training;Sparks;Credit cards;Support vector machines;Semisupervised learning","credit transactions;data handling;fraud;learning (artificial intelligence);random processes;security of data;transaction processing","unlabeled transactions;Balanced Random Forest;semisupervised scenarios;class imbalance problem;standard random forest learning strategy;semisupervised learning techniques;credit card fraud detection problem;machine learning techniques;strong class imbalance;Big Data;ML training;fraudulent transactions automatic detection;Spark platform;Hadoop file system support","","3","","30","","30 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Media manipulation is now a pressing societal problem with broad implications. In the past, it required significant skill to create compelling manipulations because editing tools, such as Adobe Photoshop, required experienced users to alter images convincingly. Over the last several years, the rise of machine learning-based technologies has dramatically lowered the skill necessary to create compelling manipulations. For example, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can create photo-realistic faces with no skill by an end-user other than the ability to refresh a web page. Deepfake algorithms, such as autoencoders to swap faces in a video, can create manipulations much more easily than previous generation video tools. While these ML techniques have many positive uses, they have also been misused for darker purposes such as to perpetrate fraud, to create false personas, and to attack personal reputations. Clearly, these are pressing and important problems for which technical solutions must play a role.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2020.3011085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9177412","","Special issues and sections;Forensics;Media;Authentication;Information integrity;Detectors;Forgery;Generative adversarial networks;Image processing;Digital forensics;Digital images","","","","","","0","IEEE","25 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
