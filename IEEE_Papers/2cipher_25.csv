We, in this paper propose novel idea of combining algebraic and side channel attacks on stream ciphers. Algebraic cryptanalysis has a high cost when pitched against stream ciphers with nonlinear update and for side channel attacks, adversary needs to have a continued access to cipher's implementation. On the other hand combining both these attacks can overcome their individual shortcomings to a great extent, thereby making it practically feasible. Algebraic and side channel attacks have been earlier combined on block ciphers, but no work on applying such attacks against stream ciphers has been published so far.","","978-1-5090-5984-3","10.1109/COMTECH.2017.8065763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8065763","Algebraic attack;Side channel attack;Algebraic side channel attack;Stream ciphers;Cryptanalysis","Ciphers;Side-channel attacks;Mathematical model;Complexity theory;Hamming weight;Transforms","algebra;cryptography","side channel attacks;stream ciphers;cryptanalysis technique;brute force attack;attack techniques;algebraic cryptanalysis;block ciphers","","4","","25","","12 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It also eliminates the fact that a diagram and its reverse will encrypt in a similar fashion. 3D-Playfair cipher supports all 26 alphabets, 10 digits and 28 special characters. The theme of research is to furnish security to data which contains alphabets numerals and special characters during transmission that's why additional bitwise operations are introduced and applied on the cipher text of 3D-Playfair cipher with a random key. Linear Feedback Shift Register is a good candidate for generation of random sequences and is selected for generating random keys for bitwise operations to offer better security to cipher text before transmission over the internet.

This paper explores the combination of LFSRs and CA as the key components of an efficient stream cipher design for implementation on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The proposed stream cipher design builds upon a recent published design known as A2U2. The suite of statistical tests found in the Diehard program is utilized to evaluate the quality of random numbers from the proposed CA-based stream cipher.

Hence, it is important to model the performance of the cipher design. This article presents a novel energy model for light-weight block cipher hardware implementation based on the design parameters.

To accomplish this phenomenon, two varieties of security mechanism, cryptography and steganography is being applied. At the former stage, encryption is being provided to secret plain text using Vernam cipher (One-Time Pad) transposition technique, since Vernam cipher show good performance metrics in terms of less CPU running time, file size same after encryption and strong avalanche effect compare with all transposition cipher. And at the later stage, it transform cipher text into bytes and divides each byte into pairs of bits and assigns the decimal values to each pairs, which is known as master variable, master variable value range will be vary between 0 to 3. Depending upon the master patchy value, add that cipher text in the career image at Least Significant Bit (LSB) 6th and 7th bit location or 7th and 8th bit location or 7th and 6th or 8th and 7th bit location. Which shows the embedding location dynamicity of the algorithm depends upon dynamically changed master variable value. After completion of embedding and sending the stego image to the receiver side, retrieving process of the cipher text from the said locations will be done. And then decryption process to get the secret plain text back will be performed using the Vernam cipher transposition algorithms. In this we provide robust image steganography.

Particular attention is paid to its representative built using diagonal groups and general linear groups over a Galois field. Within the scope of this work this subclass and its aforesaid representative are designated as “group-based knapsack ciphers” and “matrix-based knapsack cipher”, respectively. The given cryptosystems deserve consideration in the context of the post-quantum cryptography, since the general knapsack problem is NP-complete. The investigated characteristics of cryptographic schemes comprise the ciphertext expansion coefficient as well as a performance of the encryption and decryption procedures. Building a group-based knapsack cipher faces the problem of choosing such underlying groups that would allow this cryptosystem to have good characteristics. Thus, the results of the analysis show that in spite of the acceptable aforementioned performance characteristics, the matrix-based knapsack cipher suffers from a large expansion of encrypted data. Therefore, this cryptosystem cannot yet be considered as the one of the most promising ciphers suitable for use in the post-quantum era.","","978-1-5386-5903-8","10.1109/DESSERT.2018.8409143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8409143","group-based knapsack ciphers;matrix-based knapsack cipher;time complexity;ciphertext expansion;post-quantum cryptography;knapsack cryptosystems","Ciphers;Encryption;Buildings;Quantum computing;Matrices;Galois fields","computational complexity;Galois fields;knapsack problems;quantum cryptography","general knapsack problem;group-based knapsack cipher;matrix-based knapsack cipher;post-quantum era;finite groups;diagonal groups;general linear groups;decryption procedures;encryption procedures;ciphertext expansion coefficient;NP-complete;post-quantum cryptography;Galois field","","","","14","","12 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In heterogeneous network where different protocols are used to convert the data from one device to another, it is important that all security conversion should have high speed. In this multi-user environment call dropping should not take place. In order to maintain speed it is important that the security codes have a great data rate. The various channel attacks and multi path nature of code makes it vulnerable to attack. The acute exchange of time and frequency parameters makes the physical layer elements liable to security related attacks. Signal protection at the physical layer is significant in LTE system. Stream cipher is a symmetric cipher which can be used for cryptographic protection in wireless system.

In the world of cryptography, chaos theory is used to generate numbers at random. This random number will then be used as the key in performing the encryption process. The chaos function is a function that has a sensitive nature to the initial value, meaning that a small change in the initial value will result in a major change in the value of the next function. Such properties can be applied in cryptography to maintain data integrity, especially in stream cipher cryptographic algorithms such as vigenere cipher, vigenere cipher algorithms have problems with very low security levels. In the vigenere cipher algorithm a key, called the initial key, is made of a key longer than the initial key called a key stream that is very easy to solve. The application of chaotic function in vigenere cipher can improve the security of the key used, since the chaos function can generate random numbers for the initial key on the vigenere cipher algorithm that has the sensitive properties at the initial value.","","978-1-5386-5434-7","10.1109/CITSM.2018.8674376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8674376","Chaos function;Vigenere cipher;Key stream electricity","Ciphers;Chaos;Encryption;Logistics;Mathematical model","chaos;cryptography;data integrity;random number generation","vigenere cipher algorithm;chaos function;random number;chaos theory;stream cipher cryptographic algorithms;security algorithm cryptography;ciphertext security;encryption process;data integrity;crystallographic algorithm","","3","","11","","28 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we investigate methods of simple power analysis applied to stream ciphers based on multiple feedback shift registers (FSRs) and demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods by examining the cipher Grain which involves both a linear and a nonlinear FSR. A divide-and-conquer attack is presented where the attacker guesses the bit values of the FSRs independently and then checks the correctness of the guess using information derived from measured power consumption of the cipher core. Experimental results of the attack applied to simulated power data obtained for a CMOS implementation of Grain show that it is possible to recover directly the cipher state using only about 3000 power samples. For ciphers constructed using a general architecture of multiple FSRs, the attack has the potential to be successful with a complexity substantially less than exhaustive key search.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxu021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8187813","stream ciphers;side channel attacks;simple power analysis;Grain stream cipher","","","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The most important aspect of the emerging communication technologies is to ensure the safety and security of the generated huge amount of data. Hence, cryptography is considered as a pathway that can securely transfer and save the data. Cryptography comprises of ciphers that act like an algorithm, where the data is encrypted at the source and decrypted at the destination. This paper comprises of two ciphers namely PRESENT and AES ciphers. In the real-time applications, AES is no more relevant especially for segmenting the organizations that leverage RFID, Sensors and IoT devices. In order to overcome the strategic issues faced by these organization, PRESENT ciphers work appropriately with its super lightweight block figure, which has the equivalent significance to both security and equipment arrangements. This paper compares the AES (Advance encryption standard) symmetric block cipher with PRESENT symmetric block cipher to leverage in the industries mentioned earlier, where the huge consumption of resources becomes a significant factor. For the comparison of different ciphers, the results of area, timing analysis and the waveforms are taken into consideration.","","978-1-7281-7089-3","10.1109/ICISS49785.2020.9315883","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9315883","PRESENT block cipher;AES cipher;Ultra-light weight;Area;Timing;Cryptography;IoT","Ciphers;Cryptography;Registers;Encryption;Sensors;Hardware;Conferences","private key cryptography","cryptography;AES symmetric block cipher;Advance encryption standard;PRESENT symmetric block cipher","","","","25","","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The power consumption of Midori is the lowest of all available ciphers. In hardware security, side-channel attacks pose a danger because they illegally analyze the secret key in a cryptographic device using the power consumption and electromagnetic waves generated during the device's operation. One type of side-channel attack that uses electromagnetic waves is called electromagnetic analysis. To examine the safety of future IoT devices, it is extremely important to investigate the resistance of Midori, an extremely low-power cipher, to electromagnetic analysis (tamper resistance). However, to our knowledge, no studies have reported on electromagnetic analysis against Midori. The present study proposes a method of electromagnetic analysis.","","978-1-5386-1104-3","10.1109/UEMCON.2017.8248990","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8248990","security of IoT;electromagnetic analysis;low power cipher;Midori;tamper resistance","Electromagnetic analysis;Hamming distance;Electromagnetic scattering;Ciphers;Power demand;Encryption","computational electromagnetics;cryptography;Internet of Things;power consumption","hardware security;secret key analysis;extremely low-power cipher;tamper resistance;low-power cipher;future IoT devices;electromagnetic waves;cryptographic device;side-channel attack;available ciphers;power consumption;ultra low power cipher Midori;electromagnetic analysis method","","","","12","","8 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
