When the data are received, they are decoded and applied to generate the input for the next iteration. After that, the generated input is transmitted following the same procedure as the output transmission, that is, encoding, quantizing, transmitting, and decoding. For this learning tracking framework, the asymptotic zero-error tracking performance is strictly proved for both infinite- and finite-level uniform quantizers.

However, their decoding algorithms suffer from very high computational complexity. In this paper, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed, named parity-check erased algorithm (PCEA), where an additional parity check bit is added to each symbol of the codeword when encoding and a series of simple operations are performed based on these bits during decoding. As a universal joint coding and decoding algorithm, the PCEA can be combined with arbitrary NB-LDPC encoding schemes and decoding algorithms based on message passing. The proposed algorithm facilitates significant improvement of decoding performance with a small decrease of the code rate. Additionally, it usually has an even better performance than a nearly same-rate code constructed by the original method, and requires much lower decoding complexity due to smaller size of the parity check matrix.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-0397-6","10.1109/ISCAS.2019.8702165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8702165","Non-binary low-density parity-check codes;additional parity check bits;joint coding and decoding algorithm;low complexity","Decoding;Encoding;Iterative decoding;Simulation;Computational complexity","computational complexity;decoding;message passing;parity check codes","NB-LDPC codes;moderate codeword length;high-order modulation;high computational complexity;arbitrary NB-LDPC encoding schemes;decoding performance;code rate;parity check matrix;decoding complexity;universal joint coding and decoding algorithm;parity check bit;parity-check erased algorithm;non-binary low-density parity-check codes;novel low-complexity joint coding and decoding algorithm","","2","","15","","1 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Surprisingly, although the validity of all sequences could be thought as a drawback with respect to the cost of noncoherent sequence decoding, in fact it turns out to be an advantage. Based on recent results in the context of quadratic-form maximization over finite alphabets, we exploit the full-rate property of the proposed scheme to develop a polynomial-complexity maximum-likelihood noncoherent sequence decoder whose order is solely determined by the number of receive antennas.

Of these the major concern is that of crosstalk and its consequences. In the past, multiple techniques such as shielding, use of repeaters and guard rings were proposed to alleviate the undesired signal transitions. These bygone techniques where debunked since implementing them resulted in additional wires which increases routing area. These shortcomings laid the path towards innovative encoding schemes like the No Adjacent Transitions (NAT), Boundary Shift Coding (BSC) and Bus invert technique etc. This paper proposes a novel Zero Crosstalk Encoding Scheme and explores its potential applications to alleviate the concerns of crosstalk in decisive communication modules.

We first design the product information code based on the features of product and further perform convolutional coding. Then, a corresponding grayscale matrix is generated based on the basic information matrix and the relationship between the matrix elements. By decoding the discretized matrix formed by the basic information matrix and the grayscale matrix, we can recover the information matrix that has been damaged and finally to realize the traceability of the goods. After testing a lot of data, the results show that the method can obtain a much higher recovery ratio of commodity's information even when the damage ratio of the outer package exceeds half.","1559-9450","978-4-8855-2316-8","10.23919/PIERS.2018.8598029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8598029","","Channel coding;Decoding;Gray-scale;Electromagnetics;Matrix converters;Simulation","convolutional codes;decoding;encoding;matrix algebra;packaging","basic information matrix;discretized matrix;decoding method;grayscale-information matrix;encoding decoding matrix;goods packaging;product information code;tracing techniques;grayscale matrix;anti-counterfeiting techniques","","","","4","","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed work is an attempt to stop the losses by preventing the power theft, using encoding and decoding techniques of the analog signal. Encoding is done at the distribution transformer and the decoding circuit is incorporated within the smart electrical energy meter. The power line between the distribution transformer and the energy meter is protected as encoded power flows through it which cannot be used for running the home appliances, therefore providing protection against illegal distribution line tapping's.

It involves a set of commands that are understandable and familiar to the user. Data compression is an essential requirement for lossless data transmission. Message bits are encoded in the transmitter end so as to avoid errors and redundancy during the transmission of information. Huffman code is a prefix type code which compresses the message bits by knowing the frequency of occurrence of each character or probability of each symbol. A Huffman/binary tree is formed based on the occurrence of the symbols and symbols are then encoded. Huffman algorithm implements bottom-up approach. Each symbol encoded with the Huffman tree logic is decodable. Each encoded information can be decoded by tracing from the top of the tree to the required symbol. This paper introduces the implementation of this algorithm using Julia programming language supported by Jupyter platform. This encoding algorithm is the most efficient way of compressing data.","","978-1-5090-0396-9","10.1109/ICCSP.2016.7754207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7754207","Binary tree;Data compression;Huffman algorithm;IJulia;Julia language;Jupyter;Kernel;prefix code","Decoding;Algorithm design and analysis;Binary trees;Signal processing algorithms;Channel coding;Data compression","data compression;decoding;encoding;Huffman codes;trees (mathematics)","Huffman encoding algorithm;Huffman decoding algorithm;IJulia interactive platform;learning platform;coding technique;data compression;lossless data transmission;Huffman prefix type code;message bits compression;binary tree;bottom-up approach;Huffman tree logic;Julia programming language;Jupyter platform","","","","5","","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This re-encoding and coordinate transformation converts the original interpolation problem into another reduced interpolation problem, which is orders of magnitude smaller than the original one. A formal proof is presented to show that the two interpolation problems are indeed equivalent. An efficient factorization procedure that applies directly to the reduced interpolation problem is also given.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2096034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5695132","Algebraic decoding;bivariate interpolation;list-decoding;polynomial factorization;Reed‚ÄìSolomon codes","Interpolation;Polynomials;Decoding;Complexity theory;Software algorithms","algebraic codes;encoding;Reed-Solomon codes","algebraic list decoding;Reed Solomon code;bivariate polynomial interpolation;coordinate transformation","","32","2","24","","20 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
