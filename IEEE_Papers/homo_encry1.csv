Many types of encryption algorithms were applied in the cloud for securing the data. Data can be stored in the cloud in an encrypted form. So, a new technique called Homomorphic encryption is introduced that allows to apply specific operations on the encrypted data. The paper presents an overview of security issues in cloud computing and utilization of the fully homomorphic encryption technique has drawbacks of large key size and low calculation efficiency, and it is not practical for the secure cloud computing. We build up a hybrid homomorphic encryption scheme based on the GM encryption algorithm which is additively (single bit) homomorphic, and RSA algorithm which is multiplicative homomorphic. The hybridization of homomorphic encryption schemes seems to be an effective way to defeat their limitations and to benefit from their resistance against the confidentiality attacks. This hybridization of homomorphic encryption algorithm lead to increase the speed (2.9) times, reduce the computation time to 66% percentage from previous one, enhanced confidentiality of the data that is stored in the cloud by enhancing security (two layer of encryption methods used) . Since hybrid encryption is utilized high security and authentication is provided.","","978-1-5386-9188-5","10.1109/AiCIS.2018.00043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8640952","homomorphic-encryption;-partially-homomorphic-encryption;-hybrid-homomorphic-encryption;-RSA,-Goldwasser-Micali-GM.","Encryption;Cloud computing;Ciphers;Public key;Additives","cloud computing;cryptography","security concerns;encryption algorithms;encrypted form;encrypted data;security issues;fully homomorphic encryption technique;secure cloud computing;hybrid homomorphic encryption scheme;GM encryption algorithm;encryption methods;hybrid encryption;multistage partial homomorphic encryption","","4","","12","","14 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the user stores their data on cloud. Cloud data security must satisfy the three goals of security-confidentiality, integrity and availability. This paper focuses on confidentiality goal. Generally data on cloud is not stored in encrypted form. It is because at the time of processing it needs to be decrypted. In homomorphic encryption user or application can be able to perform computation on encrypted data. Most of the homomorphic encryption algorithm generates large cipher text which makes processing inefficient. This paper focuses on homomorphic encryption using elliptic curve cryptography scheme. In proposed homomorphic encryption scheme the size of cipher text is considerably reduced due to its smaller key size with same level of security like RSA. User can perform the operation on this low size cipher text. So in this scheme, cloud data always in encrypted form and it will not get exposed in plain text.","","978-1-78561-827-7","10.1049/cp.2016.1501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8372178","Data security;Cloud computing;Homomorphic encryption;ECC;ElGamal","","cloud computing;public key cryptography","RSA;security-confidentiality;homomorphic encryption scheme;low size cipher text;elliptic curve cryptography scheme;homomorphic encryption algorithm;homomorphic encryption user;cloud computing data security;ECC-elgamal scheme","","","","","","7 Jun 2018","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In this paper, we investigate secure estimation based on Kalman filtering (SEKF) using partially homomorphically encrypted data. The encryption will enhance the confidentiality not only of data transmitted in the communication network, but also key system information required by the estimator. We use a multiplicative homomorphic encryption scheme, but with a modified decryption algorithm. SEKF is able to conceal comprehensive information (i.e., system parameters, measurements, and state estimates) aggregated at the sink node of the estimator, while retaining the effectiveness of normal Kalman filtering. Therefore, even if an attacker has gained unauthorized access to the estimator and associated communication channels, he will not be able to obtain sufficient knowledge of the system state to guide the attack, e.g., ensure its stealthiness. We present an implementation structure of the SEKF to reduce the communication overhead compared with traditional secure multiparty computation (SMC) methods. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the SEKF on an IEEE 9-bus power system.","","978-1-5386-5301-2","10.1109/ICCPS.2018.00046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8443753","Security;State estimation;Partially homomorphic encryption;Quantization;Power system","Encryption;State estimation;Kalman filters;Sensors;Smart grids","cryptography;data privacy;Kalman filters;state estimation","secure multiparty computation methods;IEEE 9-bus power system;system state;associated communication channels;normal Kalman filtering;state estimates;system parameters;modified decryption algorithm;multiplicative homomorphic encryption scheme;key system information;communication network;SEKF;secure estimation;cyber-physical systems;trustworthy situation awareness;partially homomorphic encryption;secure Kalman filter state estimation","","3","","9","","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With this encryption technique, the validity of the arithmetic operation in a transaction can be checked without decrypting the operands. For instance, a remaining balance after fund transfer can be validated while the exact amount of the transferred fund and the final balance are kept in a ciphertext.

Experimental results show that, for the polynomial degree 2<sup>6</sup>, 2<sup>8</sup>, and 2<sup>10</sup>, the total executions are 2.2 ms, 4.4 ms, 25 ms per data, respectively. The implementation is useful for big data security such as for environment, financial and hospital data analytics.","","978-0-7381-2517-6","10.1109/Comnetsat50391.2020.9328979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328979","Data security;cloud security system;homomorphic encryption;data analytic.","Encryption;Security;Data analysis;Hospitals;Big Data;Satellites;Public key","Big Data;cloud computing;cryptography;data analysis;polynomials","data transmission;homomorphic encryption;big data security;hospital data analytics;cloud security implementation;computing and communication technologies;time 4.4 ms;time 25.0 ms;time 2.2 ms","","","","15","","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to its special functionality, the security notions of the homomorphic authenticated encryption is somewhat complicated and the construction of fully homomorphic authenticated encryption has never been given. In this work, we propose a new security notion and the first construction of fully homomorphic authenticated encryption. Our new security notion is a unified definition for data privacy and authenticity of homomorphic authenticated encryption. Moreover, our security notion is simpler and stronger than the previous ones. To realize our new security notion, we also suggest a construction of fully homomorphic authenticated encryption via generic construction. We combine a fully homomorphic encryption and two homomorphic authenticators, one fully homomorphic and one OR-homomorphic, to construct a fully homomorphic authenticated encryption that satisfies our security notion. Our construction requires its fully homomorphic encryption to be indistinguishable under chosen plaintext attacks and its homomorphic authenticators to be unforgeable under selectively chosen plaintext queries. Our construction also supports multiple datasets and amortized efficiency. For efficiency, we also construct a multi-dataset fully homomorphic authenticator scheme, which is a variant of the first fully homomorphic signature scheme. Our multi-dataset fully homomorphic authenticator scheme satisfies the security requirement of our generic construction above and supports amortized efficiency.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3100852","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea Government (MSIT), (the mathematical structure of functional encryption and its analysis)(grant numbers:2016-6-00598); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9500126","Authentication;cryptography;data security;encryption;fully homomorphic authenticated encryption;homomorphic authenticator;homomorphic encryption;security notion","Security;Encryption;Cryptography;Privacy;Encoding;Authentication;Games","","","","","","21","CCBYNCND","28 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This technology has been carried out in the election process with e-voting system. The high risk of security problem makes data encryption applied in the e-voting system. Thus, the ballot won't be interrupted by the insider or the outsider.

In this model, messages are encrypted with a PKE and computations on encrypted data are carried out using SHE or FHE after homomorphic decryption. To obtain efficient homomorphic decryption, our hybrid scheme combines IND-CPA PKE without complicated message padding with SHE with a large integer message space. Furthermore, if the underlying PKE is multiplicative, the proposed scheme has the advantage that polynomials of arbitrary degree can be evaluated without bootstrapping. We construct this scheme by concatenating the ElGamal and Goldwasser-Micali schemes over a ring ℤ<sub>N</sub> for a composite integer N whose message space is ℤ<sub>N</sub><sup>×</sup>. To accelerate the homomorphic evaluation of the PKE decryption, we introduce a method to reduce the degree of the exponentiation circuit at the cost of additional public keys. Using the same technique, we present an efficient partial solution to an open problem which is to evaluate mod q mod p arithmetic homomorphically for large p. As an independent interest, we also obtain a generic method for converting from private-key SHE to public-key SHE.

Fog computing provides more advantages in related to apply with the latest technology. On the other hand, there is an issue about the data security over processing of data. Fog Computing encounters many security challenges like false data injection, violating privacy in edge devices and integrity of data, etc. An encryption scheme called Homomorphic Encryption (HME) technique is used to protect the data from the various security threats. This homomorphic encryption scheme allows doing manipulation over the encrypted data without decrypting it. This scheme can be implemented in many systems with various crypto-algorithms. This homomorphic encryption technique is mainly used to retain the privacy and to process the stored encrypted data on a remote server. This paper addresses the terminologies of Fog Computing, work flow and properties of the homomorphic encryption algorithm, followed by exploring the application of homomorphic encryption in various public key cryptosystems such as RSA and Pailier.

The encoding procedure requires the generation of input, and for this, an approach named Particle swarm optimization is implemented in the presented research study. PSO algorithms are nature encouraged meta-heuristic algorithms. These algorithms are inhabitant reliant.

To solve this image security problem, we propose a distributed homomorphic image encryption scheme where the images of interest are those in the visible electromagnetic spectrum. In our encryption phase, a red green blue (RGB) image is first separated into its constituent channel images, and then the numerical intensity value of a pixel from each channel is written as a sum of smaller pixel intensity sub-values, leading to having several component images for each of the R, G, and B-channel images. A homomorphic encryption function is used to separately encrypted each of the pixel intensity sub-values in each component image using an encryption key, leading to a distributed image encryption approach. Each of the encrypted component images can be compressed before transmission and/or storage. In our decryption phase, each encrypted component image is decompressed if necessary, and then the homomorphic property of the encryption function is used to transform the product of individually encrypted pixel intensity sub-values in each encrypted component images, to the encryption of their sum, before applying the corresponding decryption function with a decryption key to recover the original pixel's intensity values for each channel image, and then recovering the original RGB image. Furthermore, a special case of an RGB image encryption and decryption where a pixel's intensity value from each channel is written as a sum of only two sub-values is implemented and simulated with a software. The resulting cipher-images are subject to a range of security tests and analyses. Results from these tests shown that our proposed homomorphic image encryption scheme is robust and can resist security attacks, as well as increases the security of the associated encrypted images. Our proposed homomorphic image encryption scheme has produced highly secure encrypted images.","","978-1-7281-3885-5","10.1109/UEMCON47517.2019.8993025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8993025","Distributed Image Encryption;Homomorphic Encryption;Image Encryption;Paillier Cryptographic System;RGB Image Encryption","","cryptography;image colour analysis","distributed image encryption approach;encrypted component image;individually encrypted pixel intensity sub-values;channel image;original RGB image;RGB image encryption;cipher-images;associated encrypted images;highly secure encrypted images;image security problem;distributed homomorphic image encryption scheme;encryption phase;red green blue image;constituent channel images;B-channel images;homomorphic encryption function;encryption key;pixel intensity sub-values","","1","","25","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Experimental results show that there is no significant difference in the accuracy of person re-identification with or without homomorphic encryption and linear quantization.","2378-8143","978-1-5386-6309-7","10.1109/GCCE.2018.8574615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8574615","Person Re-identification;Personal Information;Linear Quantization;Homomorphic Encryption","Encryption;Quantization (signal);Servers;Feature extraction;Authentication;Cameras","cryptography;data protection;image matching;quantisation (signal)","personal information protection;people matching;decryption;linear quantization;person re-identification;homomorphic encryption","","2","","6","","13 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
