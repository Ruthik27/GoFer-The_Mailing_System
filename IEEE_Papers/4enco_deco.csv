Generally, more than 90% of undecoded input symbols result from decoding termination within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ k/2, where n and k are the decoded and total number of input symbols, respectively. This study focuses on reducing the symbol loss probability by preventing early decoding termination. Input symbols can be divided into decoding chains with respect to the connectivity of degree-2 encoding symbols such that neighbors of a degree-2 encoding symbol belong to the same decoding chain. The number of input symbols in a decoding chain is called the chain length. It is found that the average chain length is shorter if the decoding termination occurs within 0 ≤ n ≤ k/2. We propose an encoding scheme which increases the chain length to avoid early decoding termination. Each code block is divided into two groups - the first one contains τ randomly selected input symbols, while the rest k - τ symbols form the second group. Neighbors of any degree-2 encoding symbol are restricted from different groups of input symbols. The probability that two degree-2 encoding symbols have a neighbor in common is increased, leading to longer decoding chain on average. Simulation results show that the symbol loss probability of the proposed encoding scheme is always lower than that of the LT encoding. The improvement by our scheme in the symbol loss probability increases with k. In comparison with the LT encoding, when the overhead is sufficiently large, the proposed scheme also achieve higher probability of successful decoding.","","978-4-88552-267-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6400898","LT code;degree;BP decoding;decoding chain;chain length","Encoding;Decoding;Solitons;Robustness;Receivers;Streaming media;Simulation","decoding;probability;solitons","improved LT encoding scheme;extended chain lengths;BP decoding;robust soliton distribution;undecoded input symbols;symbol loss probability;early decoding termination;decoding chains;degree-2 encoding symbols;τ randomly selected input symbols;Luby transform code","","","","14","","7 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The two encoders make distinct partial observations of a Markov source. Each encoder must encode its observations into a sequence of discrete symbols. The symbols are transmitted over noisy channels to a finite memory receiver that attempts to reconstruct some function of the state of the Markov source. Encoding and decoding must be done in real-time, that is, the distortion measure does not tolerate delays. Under the assumption that the encoders' observations are conditionally independent Markov chains given an unobserved time-invariant random variable, results on the structure of optimal real-time encoding and decoding functions are obtained. It is shown that there exist finite-dimensional sufficient statistics for the encoders. The problem with noiseless channels and perfect memory at the receiver is then considered. A new methodology to find the structure of optimal real-time encoders is employed. A sufficient statistic with a time-invariant domain is found for this problem. This methodology exploits the presence of common information between the encoders and the receiver when communication is over noiseless channels.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2161915","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6006597","Markov chains;Markov decision theory;multiterminal communication system;real-time encoding and decoding","Encoding;Receivers;Real time systems;Markov processes;Decoding;Sensors;Noise measurement","decoding;encoding;Markov processes;multicast communication","multiterminal communication system;real-time communication system;separate noisy channel;Markov source;discrete symbol;finite memory receiver;distortion measure;independent Markov chains;time-invariant random variable;optimal real-time encoding;decoding functions;finite-dimensional sufficient statistics;optimal real-time encoders;time-invariant domain;noiseless channel","","19","","41","","29 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By exploiting the sparse scattering nature of mmWave channels, the beam alignment problem is formulated as a sparse encoding and phaseless decoding problem. More specifically, the problem of interest involves finding a sparse sensing matrix and an efficient recovery algorithm to recover the support and magnitude of a sparse signal from compressive phaseless measurements. A sparse bipartite graph code algorithm is developed for sparse encoding and phaseless decoding. Our theoretical analysis shows that, in the noiseless case, our proposed algorithm can perfectly recover the support and magnitude of the sparse signal with a probability exceeding a pre-specified value from (9(K<sup>2</sup>) measurements, where K is the number of nonzero entries of the sparse signal. The proposed algorithm has a simple decoding procedure which is computationally efficient and noise robust. Simulation results show that our proposed method renders reliable beam alignment even in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime and presents a clear performance advantage over existing methods.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2019.2929460","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61829103,61871091); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8770109","Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications;beam alignment;sparse encoding;phaseless decoding","Decoding;Receivers;Array signal processing;Transmitters;Acoustic beams;Encoding;Antenna arrays","array signal processing;compressed sensing;decoding;electromagnetic wave scattering;encoding;graph theory;millimetre wave communication;omnidirectional antennas;receiving antennas;sparse matrices;transmitting antennas;wireless channels","sparse sensing matrix;sparse bipartite graph code algorithm;fast beam alignment;millimeter wave communications;phaseless decoding approach;antenna array;mmWave channels;omnidirectional antenna;hybrid analog and digital beamforming structure;beam alignment;sparse encoding approach","","9","","41","IEEE","23 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose an encoding and decoding scheme for long-distance ultrasonic localization, which is able to work on the smart phone. Inspired by Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), we propose to encode the reference signal, composed of preamble, guard interval and ID symbols, which can be used to distinguish beacons. Next, we can decode the signal by detecting preamble, estimate arrival time, demodulate ID symbols and cross-check the results. The experiment shows that the data can delivered at 5-bit in 170 ms and that more than 99 percent decoding accuracy can be achieved within 30 m localization range, which meets the needs of the localization system in the long distance.","1934-1768","978-9-8815-6390-3","10.23919/CCC50068.2020.9188875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9188875","Indoor localization;Ultrasonic;Encoding and decoding scheme;Smart phone","Decoding;Smart phones;Acoustics;Chirp;Encoding;Microphones;Multiaccess communication","code division multiple access;decoding;encoding;frequency modulation;indoor radio;signal detection;signal resolution;smart phones;ultrasonic applications","long-distance ultrasonic localization;ultrasonic localization systems;liner frequency modulation signal;high temporal resolution;complex indoor environment;encoding-decoding scheme;code division multiple access;CDMA","","","","17","","9 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The relay then quantizes the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) values received from the SISO decoder, encodes them and then transmits to the destination. The Selective-Cooperation condition determines whether the destination will accept or reject relay's collaboration. We consider half-duplex relaying with orthogonal channels at the destination and apply turbo coding at both source and relay nodes. We define a trade-off parameter that determines how much of the relay's time should be dedicated to listening and to transmission. We show by simulations that this trade-off factor has an optimal value for which the Block-Error Rate (BLER) is minimized. We compare the error rate performance of the proposed DCF-SC scheme with that of the Decode-Amplify-Forward (DAF) scheme presented in the literature.","1558-2558","","10.1109/LCOMM.2012.011312.112462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134711","Decode-compress-and-forward;iterative decoding;relay channels;turbo codes","Relays;Decoding;Signal to noise ratio;Turbo codes;Gain;Iterative decoding;Error analysis","amplify and forward communication;cooperative communication;decode and forward communication;error statistics;iterative decoding;quantisation (signal);signal processing;turbo codes;wireless channels","relay network;signal-processing scheme;decode-compress-and-forward;selective-cooperation;message broadcast;soft-input soft-output decoding;SISO decoding;quantization;log-likelihood ratio;LLR value;SISO decoder;relay collaboration;half-duplex relaying;orthogonal channel;turbo coding;source node;relay node;trade-off factor;block-error rate;BLER;error rate performance;DCF-SC scheme;decode-amplify-forward scheme;DAF scheme;iterative decoding","","20","2","9","","18 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In general, it is preferable to use a large-size list in the decoding to achieve excellent error-control performance, but this can lead to high complexity. Moreover, the list decoding is still a one-time-pass algorithm with hard-decision outputs, which is not well suited for advanced concatenated coding systems. In this paper, a novel adjustable list decoding is proposed, in which the list size can be adjusted appropriately. Based on the reliability analyses of the decoding list, dynamic thresholds are designed to precisely guide the adjustments. The adjustable list decoding can also achieve excellent error-control performance, but the complexity is significantly reduced. Moreover, we propose an iterative adjustable list decoding scheme with soft-decision outputs for concatenated polar-coding systems, in which a log-likelihood-ratio update strategy is elaborately designed. It can achieve much better error-control performance compared with the existing iterative decoding schemes, such as the belief propagation (BP) decoding, and soft cancellation (SCAN) decoding. As the number of iterations increases, the decoding performance gradually improves, but the complexity increases little due to efficient complexity control designs.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2020.3020226","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61525103,61831008); Shenzhen Basic Research Program(grant numbers:ZDSYS201707280903305); Guangdong Science and Technology Planning Project(grant numbers:2018B030322004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9186729","Polar code;list decoding;soft-decision;low complexity","Iterative decoding;Maximum likelihood decoding;Complexity theory;Encoding;Reliability;Signal processing algorithms","concatenated codes;decoding;iterative decoding;probability;Viterbi decoding","iterative soft list decoding;adjustable soft list decoding;polar codes;fixed-size list;large-size list;advanced concatenated coding systems;list size;decoding list;concatenated polar-coding systems;iterative decoding schemes;belief propagation decoding;soft cancellation decoding;decoding performance;efficient complexity control designs;error-control performance;reliability analyses;dynamic thresholds","","1","","22","IEEE","4 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The two SISO decoders exchange their outputs immediately to accelerate the update of extrinsic information and in turn to reduce the overall decoding latency, increasing the throughput by almost two times.

This paper proposes the re-encoding transformed PASD algorithm, in which Q(x, y) is progressively constructed by the low-complexity module minimization (MM) technique. Re-encoding transform (ReT) results in a common divisor for polynomials of the image of the submodule basis. It can be removed, leading to a simpler image expansion and reduction. Consequently, Q(x,y) is constructed through the isomorphic image of the progressively enlarged submodule basis.
